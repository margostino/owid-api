This data series extends from 2005-2014, and has been created through the merging of two independent estimates of access to financial services.

Data for 2011 and 2014 has been sourced from the World Bank's Global Findex (Global Financial Inclusion) Database [available at: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports], which provides several measures of financial access.
The dataset presented here is 'Account at a financial institution (% age 15+)'.
This dataset is predominantly sourced from household and census survey data.
The World Bank defines this parameter as:

"the percentage of respondents who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution; having a debit card in their own name; receiving wages, government transfers, or payments for agricultural products into an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; paying utility bills or school fees from an account at a financial institution in the past 12 months; or receiving wages or government transfers into a card in the past 12 months (% age 15+).

Earlier global estimates of global access to financial services are less certain.
To present earlier estimates, we have relied on composite measures of financial access reported in the World Bank's publication 'Finance for All?: Policies and Pitfalls in Expanding Access' (2008).
The sources from which the World Bank draws upon for this composite indicator are referenced below.

The World Bank defines this composite indicator as measuring "the percentage of the adult population with access to an account with a financial intermediary.
The indicator is constructed as follows: for any country with data on access from a household survey, the surveyed percentage is given.
For other countries, the percentage is constructed as a function of the estimated number and average size of bank accounts as discussed in Honohan (2007).
These numbers are subject to estimation error."

It should also be noted that while the majority of data is reported for the year 2005, some are sourced from earlier (thus the measurement period should be considered to extend from 2000-2005).

This data is sourced from the work of Hereforth et al.
(2020), which is a background paper for the UN FAO State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report.
It is based on data on prices for locally available food items from the World Bank's International Comparison Program (ICP) (https://icp.worldbank.org/) atched to other data on food composition and dietary requirements.The nutritional requirements used in this study are in line with the WHO's recommendations for the median woman of reproductive age.
The authors note two key two reasons for this:(1) Requirements fall roughly at the median of the entire population distribution, in the sense that least-cost diets to meet energy and nutrient requirements for people in this reference group approximate the median level of least costs for all sex-age groups over the entire life cycle.
This reference group is therefore a good representation of the population as a whole.(2) Women of reproductive age are typically a nutritionally vulnerable population group, as seen in their increased risk of dietary inadequacies (due to social practices and norms that often disadvantage them in terms of access to food), which have important consequences for themselves and their children.
Previous studies have also based their analyses on this reference group.

The authors present a global assessment of archaeological expert knowledge on land use from 10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE.
To assess and integrate archaeological knowledge toward synthesis at a global scale, the ArchaeoGLOBE Project used a crowdsourcing approach.
Archaeologists with land-use expertise were invited to contribute to a detailed questionnaire describing levels of land-use knowledge at 10 time intervals across 146 regional analytical units covering all continents except Antarctica.
Contributors selected individual regions where they had expertise; 255 individual archaeologists completed a total of 711 regional questionnaires, resulting in complete, though uneven, global coverage.
The result is an expert-based meta-analysis that uses semi-subjective (ranked) survey data to generate regional assessments of land use over time.They map the dating and extent of four 'agricultural' regimes across the world:1) Foraging: Foraging/hunting/gathering/fishing - subsistence based on hunting wild animals, gathering wild plants, and fishing, without deliberately modifying the reproduction of plants and animals that people exploit.2) Pastoralism: the exploitation of pasturelands for animal husbandry - including the breeding, care, and use of domesticated herd animals (e.g., sheep, goats, camels, cattle, horses, llamas, reindeer, and yaks).3) Extensive agriculture: swidden/shifting cultivation and other forms of noncontinuous cultivation.4) Intensive agriculture: all other forms of continuous cultivation (including irrigated and nonirrigated annual cropping, tropical agroforestry, flooded field farming, and industrial monocrop/plantation agriculture).

This dataset has been constructed by Our World in Data based on two variables.– Armed forces personnel as published by the  International Institute for Strategic Studies - The Military Balance.
This is made available via the World Bank World Development Indicators: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators– The Our World in Data population series.
Details on how this is constructed are available here: https://ourworldindata.org/population-sourcesArmed forces as a share of total population is then calculated by dividing total armed forces personnel by population and multiplying by 100.
The input and output files, and script used to calculate this data is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/owid/notebooks/tree/main/HannahRitchie/armed-forces-----Armed forces personnel are active duty military personnel, including paramilitary forces if the training, organization, equipment, and control suggest they may be used to support or replace regular military forces.Limitations and exceptions: Data excludes personnel not on active duty, therefore it underestimates the share of the labor force working for the defense establishment.
The cooperation of governments of all countries listed in “The Military Balance” has been sought by IISS and, in many cases, received.
However, some data in “The Military Balance” is estimated.Statistical concept and methodology: Military data on manpower represent quantitative assessment of the personnel strengths of the world's armed forces.
The IISS collects the data from a wide variety of sources.
The numbers are based on the most accurate data available to, or on the best estimate that can be made by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) at the time of its annual publication.
The current WDI indicator includes active armed forces and active paramilitary (but not reservists).
Armed forces personnel comprise all servicemen and women on full-time duty, including conscripts and long-term assignments from the Reserves (“Reserve” describes formations and units not fully manned or operational in peacetime, but which can be mobilized by recalling reservists in an emergency).
The indicator includes paramilitary forces.
The source of the data (IISS) reports armed forces and paramilitary forces separately, however these figures are added for the purpose of computing this series.
Home Guard units are counted as paramilitary.

Data on revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) and carbon dioxide emissions from aviation are sourced from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).In its 2018 review of commercial aviation it provides data on RPKs and CO₂ emissions for domestic flights, international flights and total emissions for each country.
Under this framework, 'international' RPKs and emissions are allocated to the <b>country of departure</b>.Our World in Data has calculated per capita RPKs and aviation emissions by dividing these values by population figures in 2018 for each country, sourced from the UN World Population Prospects: https://population.un.org/wpp/These per capita footprints do not necessarily reflect the amount of travel by locals in a given location.
This is especially true if a country has high tourist volumes: much of the departures will result from travellers rather than local residents.
We have therefore also calculated 'adjusted' aviation footprints by multiplying per capita international RPKs and CO2 emissions by an adjustment factor.This adjustment factor is taken as the ratio between inbound and outbound arrivals, sourced from the World Bank: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators.This adjustment methodology was also featured in analysis by the ICCT here: https://theicct.org/blog/staff/not-every-tonne-of-aviation-CO2

Projected species' habitat loss is projected to 2050 under a business-as-usual, plus five intervention scenarios with changes to diets or agricultural production.Business-as-usual: This assumes population growth from UN medium projections; crop yield increases in line with historical rates of improvement; and dietary changes in line with projected rises in income.Closing yield gaps: Yields increase linearly from current yields to 80% of the estimated maximum potential by 2050.
Increasing yields above 80% is rarely achieved over large areas.Halve food waste: consumer food waste and food losses in supply chains are reduced by 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.Healthier diets: Diets transition to the EAT-Lancet diet which is in line with healthy calorie and nutritional requirements.
For richer countries this would mean a reduction (but not elimination) of meat consumption.
For poorer countries, this would mean an increase.Optimize trade: agricultural production and trade is optimized to produce food in the locations with the least risk of habitat loss.
Agricultural production shifts from the 25 countries projected to have the greatest mean losses of suitable habitat across all species to countries where less than 10% of species are threatened with extinction.Combined: all four interventions are combined.

Values >100 indicate an increase in yield vs.

In this dataset almost all countries have estimates between 1970 and 2016, while roughly half the countries also reach back to 1950.— 1950 to 2100: UN WPP, World Population Prospects 2017  provides annual data for Child mortality rate for all countries in the interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx, accessed on September 2, 2017.There are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950.
To develop full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates.
This series presents the selective Gapminder dataset: we have removed data points which were estimated by Gapminder with high uncertainty and instead only include those from published sources or the United Nations dataset.
We also publish the full dataset from Gapminder for users looking for a complete series.
However, we should highlight that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty.

The Global Consumption Database is composed of individual country surveys to form a database on household consumption patterns in developing countries.
The data has been standardized following a six-step process: <ul><li>Step 1: Annualizing consumption or expenditure data:In simple cases, this amounts to using a multiplying factor determined by the recall period (the period in which households are asked to recall their expenditure during that period).
For example, food data collected for the last 7 days would be divided by 7, then multiplied by 365; monthly values by 12 etc.
</li><li> Step 2: Detecting and fixing outliers:Expenditure values were flagged to be outliers if they exceeded the average amount consumed in the third quartile plus 5 times the interquartile range (the difference between the first and third quartiles of the data).
Any flagged values need to be confirmed before imputations are made.
If three or more non-food values are flagged as outliers for a household, it was assumed this indicates a rich household; hence the flags were removed.
Households in the top two consumption quintiles were also assumed to spend unusually large shares of their income on education and jewellery.
Outlier values that did not fit either of these criteria were replaced with the weighted mean of the non-extreme values for the consumption variable in question.
</li><li> Step 3: Mapping commodities to the ICP/COICOP classification:Commodities found in each survey dataset were mapped to a standard classification of products and services, and then aggregate standard products and services into sectors and categories.
This used the International Comparison Program (ICP) classification which is equivalent to the International Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP).
</li><li> Step 4: Extrapolation to 2010:Extrapolations were undertaken to convert all consumption and population data to a common reference year, 2010.
For example, for the 2007 survey conducted in Guinea: final consumption expenditure per capita in LCU was 3,177,774 in 2010 and 1,547,012 in 2007 (the survey year).
All survey values were therefore multiplied by 3,177,774/1,547,012=2.054137.
Consumption data were converted from local currencies to international dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP$).
</li><li> Step 5: Review and validation: Data was compared with other sources, notably the respective survey reports, and the World Bank’s poverty dataset, Povcalnet.
</li><li> Step 6: Production of summary tables and metadata:The World Bank generated of a standard set of tables for each country showing consumption and demographic patterns across consumption segments.
</li></ul>For more information on the Global Consumption Database methodology see: http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Standardization of Data’ tab.As the World Bank’s Global Consumption Database draws on a variety of country surveys which differ in design, methodology, and timing, there are limits to the extent to which surveys can be standardized.
Therefore, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.
For more information see http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Note on comparability’ tab.All figures reported are based on national totals.
The World Bank notes “each survey is composed of ordinary households only; “institutional households” (prisons, military barracks, hospitals, convents, and others) are not covered by household surveys.

Variables include each country, region and World Bank income group's share of the global population; production-based (territorial); and consumption-based (trade-adjusted) carbon dioxide emissions.
This was calculated by Our World in Data based on CO₂ figures produced by Le Quéré et al.
(2017).
Global Carbon Project.
This is given as production (territorial) emissions in addition to trade-adjusted consumption-based emissions.
Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e.
territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports).
If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.Note that consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries; although those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total.
Each country's share of world emissions are based on the share of the global total minus categories termed 'bunkers' and 'statistical differences' (which include cross-boundary emissions such as international travel and shipping.Calculation of each country's share of the global population is calculated using national and global population figures from the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPPP, 2018).

OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response.
These indicators take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc.
and record them on an ordinal scale.
The remainder is financial indicators, such as fiscal or monetary measures.OxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index.
This composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from 0 to 100.
Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and should not be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.It also includes a 'COVID-19 Containment and Health Response' index which is based on the metrics used in the 'Stringency Index' plus testing policy, contact tracing, face coverings and vaccine policy.The specific policy and response categories are coded as follows:School closures:0 - No measures1 - recommend closing2 - Require closing (only some levels or categories,e.g.

From 1978, estimates include nonlicensed marriages in California.
Prior to 1960, figures exclude Alaska and Hawaii.
2.
The CDC has revised the rate of marriages for 2016 due to revised figures for Illinois.
 Rates for 2001-2009 have also been revised and are based on intercensal population estimates from the 2000 and 2010 censuses.
Populations for 2010 rates are based on the 2010 census.3.
For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards.
4.
Data for New Zealand include civil unions.5.
Germany includes the German Democratic Republic.
This series was favoured instead of 'Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)' as when compared with the OECD series matched more closely.6.

This model includes concentrations of ozone (O3) and particulate matter, including PM2.5.
These concentrations are then used to convert to health burden based on the Global Burden of Disease methodology.– Air pollution deaths from all sources includes pollution from all anthropogenic sources (fossil fuels, agriculture, residential energy use, and non-fossil industrial emissions) and natural emissions from sources such as desert dust.– Air pollution deaths from fossil fuels includes local air pollution generated from the burning of coal, oil and gas.– Air pollution deaths from all anthropogenic sources includes pollution from fossil fuels plus agriculture, residential energy use, and non-fossil industrial emissions.Our World in Data has also converted these mortality and YLL metrics into rates based on the population figures included in the study's Supplemental material.Our World in Data has also calculated fossil fuel and total anthropogenic pollution deaths as a share of total air pollution deaths based on the paper's original data.

WHO (2005a) refers to the number of deaths (up to 4000) estimated in the populations with highest exposure to radioactive fallout from the incident.
WHO (2005b) add this to further estimates by the WHO [not included in its report] on the potential death toll in individuals beyond proximate areas.

The official death toll was 573 people, all of which were premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area: In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575Estimates for Fukushima have been derived from the WHO (2013; 2016), and official death toll from the Government of Japan.The World Health Organization (WHO) Report published five years on, suggests very low risk of increased cancer deaths in Japan.
In a review of the response and long-term health impacts of Fukushima, published by Michael Reich and Aya Goto in The Lancet (2015), the authors note that: “no one has died from radiation exposure, and the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation report in 2013 stated that substantial changes in future cancer statistics attributed to radiation exposure are not expected to be observed".Sources:World Health Organisation (2013).

Death rates from energy production is measured as the number of deaths by energy source per terawatt-hour (TWh) of production.
This data combines two sources: Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P.
(2007) assessed the death rates from accidents and air pollution major energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass).
Sovacool et al.
(2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1990 to 2013.When we try to combine the two analyses referenced earlier, one issue we encounter is that neither study includes both of the major nuclear accidents in its death rate figure: Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) was published before the Fukushima disaster in 2011; and Sovacool et al.
(2016) only look at death rates since 1990, and therefore do not include the 1986 Chernobyl accident.
We have therefore reconstructed the death rate for nuclear to include both of these accidents.For Chernobyl, there are several death estimates.
We rely on the estimate published by the World Health Organization (WHO) – the most-widely cited figure – although this is considered to be too high by several researchers, including a later report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR).
The WHO estimates that 4000 people have, or will die, from the Chernobyl disaster.
This includes the death of 31 people as a direct result of the disaster and those expected to die at a later date from cancers due to radiation exposure.The disaster in Fukushima killed 574 people.
In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event.
No one died directly from the Fukushima disaster.
Instead, most people died as a result of evacuation procedures.
According to Japanese authorities 573 people died due to the impact of the evacuation and stress.To the death toll of history’s two nuclear disasters we have added the death rate that Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) estimated for occupational deaths, most from milling and mining.
Their published rate is 0.022 deaths per TWh.The sum of these three data points gives us a death rate of 0.07 deaths per TWh.Full references to the underlying studies can be found here:Sovacool, B.

Dietary compositions calculated by the OWID author (Hannah Ritchie) based on food supply statistics from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization database: FAOstat.The FAO provide annual figures from 1961 by country on daily caloric supply, fat supply (in grams), and protein supply (in grams).
To calculate the daily per capita supply of carbohydrates, we assumed an energy density by macronutrient of 4 kcal per gram of both protein and carbohydrate and 9 kcal per gram of fat (based on established nutritional guidelines reported by the FAO).
The daily supply of carbohydrates was therefore calculated as:((Daily supply of kcal)-(Daily supply of protein * 4 + Daily supply of fat * 9)) / 4The quantity of calories from each macronutrient was then calculated based on the energy density figures given above (e.g.
calories from protein was calculated by multiplting the daily supply of protein in grams by 4).The share of calories derived from each macronutrient could then be calculated by dividing the number of calories derived from a given macronutrient by the total daily caloric supply.Protein of animal origin includes protein supplied in the form of all meat commodities, eggs and dairy products, and fish & seafood.
Protein of plant origin was dervied as the difference between total protein supply and that of animal origin.References:UN Food and Agricultural Organization FAOstat food balance sheets.

This dataset was calculated by OWID based on population estimates from the UN Population Division (2017) and US Census Bureau.

Absolute differences measure the absolute difference in regional and global population estimates from the UN Population Division and US Census Bureau.
Figures were calculated as the annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus population estimates from the US Census Bureau.

Relative differences measure this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e.
(UN population - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).

Negative figures therefore represent lower UN estimates vs.
US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive values indicate higher UN estimates).

The Economic Complexity Index takes data on exports, and reduces a country’s economic system into two dimensions: (i) The number or ‘diversification’ of products in the export basket, and (ii) the quality, or ‘ubiquity’ of products in the export basket.

To measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export matrix.
That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.

From this matrix, ‘diversification’ is obtained from the distribution of country exports across products (i.e.
the sum across columns for each row); while ‘ubiquity’  is given by the share of product exports contributed by each country (i.e.
the sum across rows for each column).

To condense both dimensions into a single metric, the ECI further reduces the information in the matrix, such that countries with similar exports are close together in the ranking.


Loosely speaking, lower ECI scores correspond to countries that export very few different types of products (i.e.
export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e.
export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products).


By this logic, Germany has a high ECI score because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities.


The following visualization shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world.
Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings

As we can see, there is a clear pattern – richer countries tend to have similar economic structures, and these structures allow them to produce and export a varied basket of sophisticated products.

But what about countries endowed with rare natural resources, like petroleum, which would make a country’s export basket less ubiquitous, and hence misleadingly be assigned a more favourable ECI ranking? If a country exporting petroleum can only produce a few other products, then the low ubiquity for their export basket can be explained by these natural resources, and the ECI ranking is corrected by the country’s inability to produce different types of products.
However, if this country can also produce a diverse range of other goods, then low ubiquity correctly indicates greater economic complexity which is reflected in the ranking.
Hence, information on diversity can correct for the information of ubiquity, and vice versa.

The data here comes from the Economic Complexity Index scores published by the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity.
These are different to those published by the Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity.
As far as we are aware, the discrepancies stem from differences in the way each sources clean the underlying cross-country trade data.
You can explore differences between these two data sources here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-country-rankings-comparison?country=KOR.

Data on elephant populations was gathered on two species: the African elephant, and the Asian elephant.African elephant population data was primarily gathered from the African Elephant Database.
Available at: https://www.iucn.org/ssc-groups/mammals/african-elephant-specialist-group/african-elephant-database.
This database is maintained by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) and Great Elephant Census.
National data is available in its African Elephant Status reports: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7a8w3kk6r9hzm0r/AfESG%20African%20Elephant%20Status%20Report%202016.pdf?dl=1.Prior to 2013, this data was collected and reported on the basis of the DPPS method, where estimates were given as 'Definite', 'Probable', 'Possible' and 'Speculative'.
In its 2013 and 2015 estimates, this method was simplified and changed to 'Estimates' and 'Guesses'.
To provide comparative statistics over time, here we have taken historical data coded as 'Definite' to be equivalent to estimated elephant populations.
In 2013 and 2015 data (which is given by both methods for comparison), these figures are comparable; this therefore seems like a reasonable assumption.
It may however introduce some additional uncertainty.Long historical estimates for Africa are taken from the Great Elephant Census: http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/background-on-conservation.Figures for some countries on 'carcass ratio' are also provided.
The carcass ratio is the number of  dead elephants observed during the count, as a percentage of the total population.
Carcass ratios of more than 8 percent are considered to indicate poaching at a high enough level to cause a declining population.Asian elephant population data is sourced primarily from the Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG); UN FAO and national records.
Latest estimates are available here: https://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/2017/AsERSM%202017_Final%20Report.pdfThese have been supplemented with longer records for Nepal (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0e.htm); China (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124834); Vietnam (http://www.fao.org/3/ad031e/ad031e0f.htm); and India (https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/23637/7/07_chapter%201.pdf).Time-series estimates of total Asian elephant populations are not widely available.
The IUCN estimates there were around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century.
Today that figure is around 45,000.

This provides data on the amount of land needed to produce one unit of electricity across different energy sources.
This is based on literature review of life-cycle assessments of electricity sources: these not only include the land used for individual power plants, but also include any land use upstream in supply chains, such as mining for fuel or raw materials.2.
Electricity consumption data sourced from Ember Climate.By multiplying annual electricity consumption for each country by the average land use of different energy sources, we have calculated the amount of land that would be needed if a country got all of its electricity from a single source.

Data is based on the largest meta-analysis of food system impact studies to date, from Poore & Nemecek's 2018 study.The authors note the following about the scope of the studies included in this meta-analysis:"We derived data from a comprehensive meta-analysis, identifying 1530 studies for potential inclusion, which were supplemented with additional data received from 139 authors.
Studies were assessed against 11 criteria designed to standardize methodology, resulting in 570 suitable studies with a median reference year of 2010.
The data set covers ~38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption'.Environmental impacts are compared across several metrics: land use (m2), greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes of CO2-equivalents), eutrophying emissions (grams of PO4-equivalents), freshwater withdrawals (liters), and scarcity-weighted water (liters) which are freshwater withdrawals weighted for local water scarcity.All comparisons here are based on the global mean value per food product across all studies.Comparisons can be made in functional units: here all comparisons are made as impacts per kilogram of product.Comparisons are also made on the basis of nutritional units in two categories: per 100 grams of protein and per 1000 kilocalories.Poore & Nemecek (2018) quantified a range of footprints in nutritional units:(1) protein products, which are compared per 100 grams of protein.
Protein products include all meats, seafood, dairy, nuts, tofu and pulses.
Grains are also compared here – despite being a low-quality source of protein – since a large share of global protein is derived from cereals.(2) grains and staples, which are compared per 1000 kilocalories.Poore & Nemecek (2018) do not provide data per 100g protein for food products which are not protein-rich, or kilocalorie measures for non-stale crops.
To provide footprints for all products Our World in Data have filled these gaps by calculating footprints per nutritional unit using food composition factors from the FAO INFOODS International Database and Food Balance Sheets:http://www.fao.org/3/X9892E/X9892e05.htm#P8217_125315http://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/tables-and-databases/international-databases/en/Footprints expressed per kilogram of food product can be converted to per unit protein or kilocalorie using data on the nutrient density of food products.Where nutritional footprints are available from Poore & Nemecek (2018), this data has been used.

<strong>Definition and sources by country.</strong></br>The estimates of average age at marriage in this dataset correspond to what is known as "singulate mean age at marriage".
This is an estimate of the average number of years lived by a cohort of women or men before their first marriage.
It is an indirect estimate, obtained from survey data on marital status by age.The source of the estimates is the UN World Marriage Database (2019).
The UN World Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census and survey estimates.
For comparability, we have chosen to use only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country.
The following is a list of underlying sources, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS.
A full breakdown of the source used for each observation in the UN dataset can be found <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/un-smam-19-metadata_country_stan.csv">here</a>.<strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage: </strong></br><em>The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups.
The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x.
The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50.
In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.</em>

The estimates and projections of the number of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who are married or in a union were prepared based on data from individual countries on an age-specific basis (for five-year age groups 15-19 to 45-49).For the purpose of this data, women who are currently married or in a union are either (i) women who have been married and are not divorced, widowed or separated; or (ii) women who are living in a cohabiting union.The question usually asked in censuses and surveys is on the marital status or union status of an individual.The definitions of marital status and union status of individuals differ by the source of data, country and time period.
For example, in the United Nations principles and recommendations for census taking, only registered partnerships and consensual unions that are legal and binding under law should be reported.
However, there is considerable variation among the definitions and terminology used in surveys.
The Demographic and Health Surveys, one of the major sources of data on marital and union status, ask individuals whether they are married or ‘living together’ with a partner; however, in countries with low prevalence of cohabiting unions, the survey question is normally limited only to marriage.For a breakdown of countries by region see the UN Methodology page <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/">here</a>.<strong>Data is estimated until 2010, and projected for 2020 and 2030.

This dataset contains estimates of the frequency of violent deaths due to murder or war in modern and prehistoric state and non-state societies, based on archaeological and ethnographic evidence.For modern state societies, homicide rates are routinely published by statistical offices or other state agencies, and reliable data on war deaths are published by research institutes.
For non-state societies, we generally have two different sources of information: for the more recent past (since the late 19th century), abundant ethnographic evidence is available; for the more distant past, we have evidence from archaeological sites and skeletal remains.The main sources for this dataset are as follows:- Bowles (2009) – Did Warfare Among Ancestral Hunter-Gatherers Affect the Evolution of Human Social Behaviors?.

The full list of excluded countries and reasons for exclusion can be found in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPMtzsx-smO3_K4ReK_HMeuVLEzVZ71qHghSuAfG788/edit?usp=sharing.For a full list of source information (i.e., HMD or WMD) country by country, see: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#source-information-country-by-country.We calculate P-scores using the reported deaths data from HMD and WMD and the projected deaths for 2020–2022 from WMD (which we use for all countries and regions, including for deaths broken down by age group).
The P-score is the percentage difference between the reported number of weekly or monthly deaths in 2020–2022 and the projected number of deaths for the same period based on previous years.We calculate the number of weekly deaths for the United Kingdom by summing the weekly deaths from England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.For important issues and caveats to understand when interpreting excess mortality data, see our excess mortality page at https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid.For a more detailed description of the HMD data, including week date definitions, the coverage (of individuals, locations, and time), whether dates are for death occurrence or registration, the original national source information, and important caveats, see the HMD metadata file at https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf.For a more detailed description of the WMD data, including original source information, see their GitHub page at https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality.

	Amnesty Interntional note: 
"Amnesty
International reports only on executions, death sentences and other aspects of the use of
the death penalty, such as commutations and exonerations, where there is reasonable
confirmation.
In many countries governments do not publish information on their use of the
death penalty.
In Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty is
classified as a state secret.
During 2016 little or no information was available on some
countries – in particular Laos, North Korea (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),
Syria and Yemen – due to restrictive state practice and/or armed conflict.
Therefore, with only a few exceptions, Amnesty International’s figures on the use of the death
penalty are minimum figures.
The true figures are likely to be higher.
Where the organization
obtains fuller information on a specific country in a given year this is noted in Amnesty International's report.
In 2009 Amnesty International stopped publishing its estimated figures on the use of the
death penalty in China.
Amnesty International always made clear that the figures it was able
to publish on China were significantly lower than the reality, because of the restrictions on
access to information.
Amnesty International’s decision to stop publishing data reflected
concerns about how the Chinese authorities misrepresented Amnesty International’s
numbers.
Since 2009 the organization challenged China to publish information on the use of
the death penalty.
China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty.
However,
available information indicates that thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death
in China each year."

Data on extreme poverty projections by country and region are sourced from the Nature publication by Crespo-Cuaresma et al.
(2018).
This data is also presented visually at the World Poverty Clock: http://worldpoverty.io/index.htmlExtreme poverty is defined by the international poverty line, set at a threshold of .90 per person per day, which is adjusted for inflation (by normalising to 2011 dollars), and corrected for cross-country price differences (PPP).The UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.1 is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
'Ending extreme poverty' is assumed when a country reaches an extreme poverty level below 3% of the total population.Scenarios of future extreme poverty rates were assessed and modelled by Crespo-Cuaresma et al.
(2018) using a combination of the IMF World Economic Outlook, and multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).
The SSPs are defined broadly as follows:- SSP1: low challenges for both climate change adaptation and mitigation resulting from income growth which does not rely heavily on natural resources and technological change, coupled with low fertility rate and high educational attainment.- SSP2: the benchmark scenario and assumes the continuation of current global socioeconomic trends at the global level.
- SSP3: low economic growth coupled with low educational attainment levels and high population growth at the global level are the main elements of the narrative, which is characterized by high mitigation and adaptation challenges.- SSP4: presents a narrative of worldwide polarization, with high income countries exhibiting relatively high growth rates of income, while developing economies present low levels of education, high fertility and economic stagnation.- SSP5: presents a scenario with high economic growth (and therefore low adaptation challenges) coupled with high demand for fossil energy from developing economies, but with high global CO2 emissions.SSP2 is defined as the baseline 'business-as-usual' scenario.
The categories of 'extremely fragile', 'fragile' and 'non-fragile' have been added for reference based on the OECD (2018) States of Fragility framework.
This framework measures the fragility of countries based on multiple political and socioeconomic indicators.

The second step is to gather the necessary data to operationalise this approach, alongside imputation methods in cases where not all the necessary data are available.
The third step is to devise a method for aggregating countries’ poverty estimates on a global scale to account for countries that lack some of the relevant data.” In his publication – linked above – you find much more detail on all of the shown poverty data.

The metric of extreme single-day precipitation events measures the share of land area which experienced over a threshold percentage of precipitation in an extreme single-day burst.
The metric of an unusually high precipitation year is measured on the basis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI).
which compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data.
If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period, it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than normal will receive a positive score.
The more precipitation (compared with normal), the higher the SPI score.
The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a standard scale.
The data on unusually high precipitation shows the share of land area in the US which experienced an SPI value of 2.0 or above (well above normal) in a given year.Nine-year smoothed average trends for these metrics are also available.

The U.S.
Annual Heat Wave Index tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the United States.
While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record.
The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.Unusually high and low temperatures measure the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter.
These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night.
At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records.
After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered “unusually cold” and the warmest 10 percent are “unusually hot.” For example, if last year’s summer highs were the 10th warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year’s summer highs would be considered unusually warm.

Studies were assessed against 11 criteria designed to standardize methodology, resulting in 570 suitable studies with a median reference year of 2010.
The data set covers ~38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption'.A tonne-kilometre, abbreviated as tkm, is a unit of measure of freight transport which represents the transport of one tonne of goods (including packaging and tare weights of intermodal transport units) by a given transport mode (road, rail, air, sea, inland waterways, pipeline etc.) over a distance of one kilometre.These emissions factors by transport mode are those applied in the analysis by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018), published in Science.
These emission factors are sourced from Ecoinvent v3.3, a comprehensive database which is commonly used in international life-cycle analyses (LCA).
Emission factors can span a range of values depending on factors such as the efficiency of vehicle used; packing/loading density of freight; distribution between passenger and freight allocation in shared transport; amongst other factors.

food = production + imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use − animal feed – seed – wastage − additions to stock).
Wastage includes losses of usable products occurring along distribution chains from farm gate (or port of import) up to the retail level.
However, such values do not include consumption-level waste (i.e.
retail, restaurant and household waste) and therefore overestimates the average amount of food actually consumed.

The study categorized countries into four categories based on their stage in the forest transition.As, detailed, they follow a similar framework to Hosonuma et al.
(2012)."Countries exhibiting low deforestation rates are classified as pre- or post-transition depending on whether forest cover is high or low (or if net reforestation is occurring); countries with high deforestation rates are classified as early-transition if gross deforestation is increasing and remaining forest cover is not too low, and late-transition otherwise.
We decided to use a slightly lower threshold than Hosonuma et al (2012).
We also manually adjusted the classification for a few post-transition countries that were not classified as such and excluded countries with less than 5% forest cover."Hosonuma describe the Forest Transition Model as:"The four FT phases are pre-transition, early transition, late transition and post-transition, which generally represent a time sequence of national development.
Pre-transition countries have high forest cover and low deforestation rates.
In early-transition countries, forest cover is lost at an increasingly rapid rate.
Late-transition countries with a rather small fraction of remaining forests exhibit a slowing of the deforestation rate and eventually come into the post-transition phase, where the forest area change rate becomes positive and forest cover increases through reforestation.
The FT model reflects a broad-scale typology of tropical developing countries, applicable as a proxy for analyzing the temporal variability of drivers of deforestation and forest degradation."Additional references:Hosonuma, N., Herold, M., De Sy, V., De Fries, R.

The carbon budget refers to the maximum quantity of carbon which can be released to maintain a 50 percent probability of global average temperature rise remaining below two-degrees celcius (the target set within the UN Paris climate agreement).

This has been measured relative to the quantity of carbon which would be released if all fossil fuel reserves were burned without the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.
The difference between the two is defined as 'unburnable carbon'.

Per capita CO2 emissions have been calculated based on the combination of global emissions data from CDIAC (described below), and UN Population Prospects data.

Population data was derived from: The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) collected the data by earlier publications.
For the 'OurWorldInData'-series we used various sources: The data for the period before 1900 are taken from the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE).
The data for the World Population between 1900 and 1940 is taken from the UN puplication 'The World at Six Billion'.
The annual data for the World Population between 1950 and 2015 is taken from the UN's World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision.
It is the series 'Total Population - Both Sexes' online available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/.

Emissions data have been sourced from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC) database.
Emissions data have been converted from units of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2) using a conversion factor of 3.67.

CDIAC denote a "statistical difference" component which has been included in this data.
This statistical difference represents the difference between estimated global CO2 emissions and the sum of national totals.
Estimates of CO2 emissions show that the global total of emissions is not equal to the sum of emissions from all countries.
This is introduced in several cases: emissions within international territories, which are included in global totals but not attributed to individual countries; inconsistent national reporting where global import and export data is imbalanced; and differing treatment of non-fuel uses of hydrocarbons.

Full methodology on global, regional, national and statistical difference estimations can be found in Le Quere et al.

"""
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the absolute number of deaths across mortality cause and risk factors for any given year.
It is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths.
Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: "the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury." Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.
Risk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of death.
For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability of lung cancer.
In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.
In order to identify and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of causes of death and risk factors.
Many of the variables are straightforward causes of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities.
However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we have instead presented the IHME's attributed figures by risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking.
Identification of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates.
Causes and risk factors are further clarified as follows:
'Outdoor air pollution' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone.
'Drug use' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol].
This is distinguished from 'drug disorders' which refers to direct death as a result of drug dependence and drug abuse.
'Alcohol disorders' refers to death as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from 'alcohol use', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.
'Road accidents' includes deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.

'Nutritional deficiencies' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.

To reflect the multidimensional nature of hunger, the GHI combines four component indicators into one index score.
An increase in a country's GHI score indicates that the hunger situation is worsening, while a decrease in the score indicates an improvement in the hunger situation.The four indicators used to calculate the GHI are:- Undernourishment: the proportion of undernourished people as a percentage of the population;- Child wasting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from wasting (low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition);- Child stunting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from stunting (low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition); and- Child mortality: the mortality rate of children under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments).The formula and weighting of these four indicators in relation to the final index score can be found at: https://www.globalhungerindex.org/pdf/en/2021.pdfThe 2021 GHI has been calculated for 135 countries for which data on the four component indicators are available and where measuring hunger is considered most relevant.
GHI scores are not calculated for some higher-income countries where the prevalence of hunger is very low.Where original source data were unavailable, the GHI was estimated based on the most recent data available.
For 19 countries, individual scores could not be calculated owing to lack of data.
12 of those countries (Burundi, Comoros, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Moldova, Niger, South Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) were provisionally designated by severity.

Smil's estimates of traditional biomass are only available until 2015.
For the years 2016 onwards, we have assumed a similar level of traditional biomass consumption.
This is approximately in line with recent trends in traditional biomass from Smil's data.Our World in Data has normalised all BP fossil fuels data to terawatt-hours (TWh) using a conversion factor of 277.778 to convert from exajoules (EJ) to TWh.This dataset includes primary energy data using two methodologies.(1) 'direct' primary energy, which does not take account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production.
Fossil fuel data in its input equivalents (in exajoules) is compared to electricity generation (not in input equivalents) of nuclear and renewables.(2) 'substitution' primary energy, which does take account of inefficiencies in fossil fuel production.
This converts non-fossil energy to their 'input equivalents' – the amount of primary energy that would be needed if they had the same inefficiencies as fossil fuels.
This is the methodology adopted in the BP statistics when all data is compared in exajoules.

In 69 countries, the reporting year of tax revenue coincides with the calendar year, whereas 11 have different reporting years.
 Where the GDP reporting year differs from the calendar year, annual GDP estimates are calculated by aggregating quarterly GDP estimates corresponding to each country’s fiscal (tax) year.For further information on the OECD classification of taxes, see the OECD's Revenue Statistics Interpretative Guide (2017) available at: https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/oecd-classification-taxes-interpretative-guide.pdfFor a more extensive discussion of revenue statistics, see the full <a href="http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-2522770x.htm">OECD Revenue Statistics 2018</a> report.

Data denotes the global warming potential (GWP) over a 100-year timescale for greenhouse gases relative to the GWP of carbon dioxide (which is denoted as 1).
Global warming potential measures the relative warming impact of one unit mass of gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide.
For example, a GWP value for gas 'x' of 25 would mean one tonne of 'x' would have 25 times the warming impact of one tonne of carbon dioixde.GWP100 values are used to convert greenhouse gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metric by multiplying emissions in mass terms by their respective GWP100 factors.In the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5), it presents GWP both with and without climate change feedback effects.
For some gases, for example methane, this can introduce significant uncertainty.
In the case of methane, the GWP100 value without feedbacks is 28; with feedbacks this increases to 34.
In its official figures the IPCC adopts GWP100 factors without climate change feedbacks.
Here we present the same figures without climate change feedbacks to maintain consistency with the IPCC.

A baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week.
The baseline day is the median value from the 5‑week period Jan 3 – Feb 6, 2020.For each region-category, the baseline isn’t a single value—it’s 7 individual values.
The same number of visitors on 2 different days of the week, result in different percentage changes.
So, we recommend the following:– Don’t infer that larger changes mean more visitors or smaller changes mean less visitors.– Avoid comparing day-to-day changes.
Especially weekends with weekdays."Mobility trends are measured across six broad categories:(1) Residential: places of residence.(2) Grocery & Pharmacy stores: places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.(3) Workplaces: places of work.(4) Parks: places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens.(5) Transit stations: places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.(6) Retail & Recreation: places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters.The 'Residential' category shows a change in duration—the other categories measure a change in total visitors.This index is smoothed to the rolling 7-day average.

This dataset was compiled to compare the government expenditure per primary student () with learning outcomes.
Because of the patchy nature of the government expenditure data as obtained from the World Bank EdStats Dataset, the most recent available expenditure data were used while 2006 was used as a cut-off point.
The measure of learning outcome used is the share of students either achieving or not achieving a minimum proficiency benchmark.
Achievement outcomes come from standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional tests.
In order to maximize coverage by country, tests have been harmonized and pooled across subjects (math, reading, science) and levels (primary and secondary education).
Higher proficiency benchmarks that represent the missing share of 100% are students that reached intermediate or advanced proficiency levels.

The data consist of government revenue, non-interest government expenditure, and the interest bill (and thus also the overall fiscal balance and the primary balance), as well as gross public debt, all expressed as a share of GDP...About half of the observations for the fiscal variables in our dataset are drawn from various cross-country sources, including the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) and International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the OECD Analytical Database...We hand-collected the other half of the data from country-specific sources, such as official government publications or economic histories that included public finance statistics."IMF data on government expenditure does not include interest paid on debt payments.
In order to derive government expenditure with interest paid on debt included, the datasets "government expenditure, percent of GDP" and "interest paid on public debt, percent of GDP" from the IMF database.This data is therefore inclusive of interest on debt payments.

Human appropriation of land for food: The role of diet.
Full reference below.The authors calculate the HALF (Human appropriation of land for food) index, which measures the percentage of total land area we would need for the global population to consume the average diet of any given country.
This is based on population and dietary figures from FAO 2011 data.OWID have re-calculated these figures as the percentage of habitable land area (rather than total land area).
This corrects for land which is either barren or glacial land and could not be used for agriculture or other land uses.
To correct for this factor, we have assumed that 71% of total land area as habitable (with 10% glaciers and 19% barren land); figures based on WWF (2016).
Living Planet Report 2016.A HALF Index value of 100% means that 100% of global habitable land area would be needed as agricultural land to provide for global diets.

current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments.
Health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance (“public”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“private”).
This indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing (“public”, “private”, “out-of-pocket”) and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs)."

The HGI is constructed by following Hausmann et al.
(2012) who created the Global Gender Gap index (GGG).
The composite index includes the gender differences in four dimensions, health, socio-economic resources, household and politics.
Health is measured by life expectancy and sex ratios whereas socio-economic resources are captured by average years of education and labour force participation.
The gender disparities in the household are captured by the marriage ages and the data on distribution of parliamentary seats between men and women is used as an indication of gender disparities in the politics.
Each of these variables is presented in female/male ratio.
Before creating the composite index, values above 1 were truncated to be 1 except for sex ratio where the equality benchmark is set to be 0.944.
For health and socio-economic resources, we have two indicators capturing these dimensions.
We have given a weight to each of these indicators, so that the variable with higher standard deviation would not get a higher weight in the sub-index.
Thus we normalize the variables in each sub-index by first determining what a 1% point change would translate into in the standard deviations (calculated by dividing .01 by the standard deviation of each variable), then determining the weight to each variable.
As a final step, the total of the four sub-indexes was taken, divided by four and multiplied by 100 for the ease of interpretation.
A higher score in our index thus highlights less gender inequality in favour of women.
A more detailed discussion of the composite index is provided in Dilli et al.
(2014).Note: this is an expanded version compared to the one released in 2014.
In line with the procedure required for the How was life report (Carmichael et al.

Respondents’ personal experiences with homelessness were assessed by querying whether they had ever considered themselves homeless or in another precarious housing situation, following up with items directed at ascertaining the age at which they experienced homelessness, the duration of the episode of homelessness, and whether they were literally homeless (slept in a shelter, in a park) or 'precariously housed' (slept at a friend’s house because they had no other place to go)."

Author's note: "We construct a complete data set of historical enrollment ratios, subdivided by education level and gender, for 111 countries from 1820 to 1945 (at five-year intervals) by using newly compiled census observations and information on the year of establishment of the oldest school in individual countries.
Then, by utilizing these enrollment ratios, as well as available census data from 1945 onward on different age groups' educational attainment, we construct a data set of estimated educational attainment, disaggregated by gender and age group, and aggregate human capital stock that spans from 1870 to 2010."For regional estimates, the authors classify the following countries as 'Advanced Economies': Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, USA, United Kingdom.

The Human Capital Index (HCI) combines indicators of health and education into a measure of the human capital that a child born today can expect to obtain by her 18th birthday, given the risks of poor education and health that prevail in the country where she lives.
The HCI is measured in units of productivity relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, and ranges from 0 to 1.
A value of x on the HCI indicates that a child born today can expect to be only x x100 percent as productive as a future worker as she would be if she enjoyed complete education and full health.
Ranging between 0 and 1, the index takes the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve fullhealth (defined as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and complete her education potential(defined as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18).
HCI is calculated based on the metrics of probability of survival to age 5, expected years of school, harmonized test scores, learning-adjusted years of schooling, stunting and adult survival rates.

The easiest way to illustrate the improvements in labor productivity in cotton spinning over time is to reproduce data on labor productivity from Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule, from which the measure of OHP (operative hours to process 100 lbs of cotton) is applied to other technologies, as shown.
[Please see table 2 on page 20 for the original data.]

Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule provides a historical introduction of the invention of the spinning mule in the 18th century.
The spinning mule was worked by hand with the spinner manually controlled all its operations.
It was around 1825 that Richard Roberts invented the ‘quadrant winding motion’ that enabled the machine to operate automatically.

Land under cereal production index was derived by OurWorldinData based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).The land under cereal production index measures annual land use for cereal production as an index to land use in 1961, the first year of the original dataset.
This index was calculated by dividing land used for cereals (which is measured in hectares) in any given year by land use in 1961.
1961 = 100.
Values >100 indicate an increase in land use vs.
1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.World/global figures from this World Bank dataset include boundary issues for land under cereal production prior to 1991: this data does not include land within the Former Soviet Union (USSR) and therefore underestimates global land use.
To aim to correct for this, we have summed the total land area of production for all countries within the former USSR from 1992, and have added this value to the global total for all years from 1961-1991.
Data from 1991 onwards has not been changed.The original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was "Land under cereal production (hectares)", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as: "Land under cereal production refers to harvested area, although some countries report only sown or cultivated area.
Cereals include wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains.
Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only.
Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded."Data available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators [accessed 18th July 2017]

Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on estimates by James C.
Riley, Clio Infra, and the United Nations Population Division.For regional- and global-level data pre-1950, we use data from a study by Riley, which draws from over 700 sources to estimate life expectancy at birth from 1800 to 2001.Riley estimated life expectancy before 1800, which he calls "the pre-health transition period".
"Health transitions began in different countries in different periods, as early as the 1770s in Denmark and as late as the 1970s in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa".
As such, for the sake of consistency, we have assigned the period before the health transition to the year 1770.
"The life expectancy values employed are averages of estimates for the period before the beginning of the transitions for countries within that region.
...
This period has presumably the weakest basis, the largest margin of error, and the simplest method of deriving an estimate."For country-level data pre-1950, we use Clio Infra's dataset, compiled by Zijdeman and Ribeira da Silva (2015).For country-, regional- and global-level data post-1950, we use data published by the United Nations Population Division, since they are updated every year.
This is possible because Riley writes that "for 1950-2001, I have drawn life expectancy estimates chiefly from various sources provided by the United Nations, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, and the Human Mortality Database".
For the Americas from 1950-2015, we took the population-weighted average of Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean, using UN Population Division estimates of population size.

The adult literacy rate is defined as the percentage of survey respondents, aged 15 and above, who can read.
The 155 literacy variable indicates whether a respondent who attended primary schooling can read a whole or part of a sentence showed.
A respondent who attended secondary education or higher are coded 2 as well as respondent who could read a whole sentence.
Possible categories include: 0 - cannot read at all; 1 - able to read only parts of sentence; 2 - able to read whole sentence; 3 - no card with required language; 4 - blind/visually impaired.
Our estimates exclude those in categories 3 and 4.
The methodology for constructing this variable is as follows:<ul><li>The DHS surveys for men and women were pooled</li><li>Created a dichotomous literacy variable, combining categories 1 'able to read only parts of sentence' with 2 'able to read whole sentence' to represent literate respondents, and 0 'cannot read at all' for illiterate respondents</li><li>Summed the total number of respondents who were classified as literate and the total number of respondents, for each country in each year</li><li>Calculated the literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of people in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li><li>Calculated the female literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of females in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li><li>Calculated the male literacy rate (% of total respondents) = (number of males in category 1 and 2 / number of respondents) * 100 </li></ul>The number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year.
Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution.
DHS surveys are conducted approximately every 5 years in phases.
The literacy variable (155) is available from phase 4 onward.
Hence, Phase 7 corresponds to 2015; phase 6 to 2010; phase 5 to 2005; and phase 4 to 2000.
 As this dataset brings together a number of countries across various phases, the year has been assigned according to the survey phase.
Note the actual year the survey was conducted in a country may differ to the year assigned, but the survey will have been undertaken within the five year interval between each phase.

The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure of the state of global biological diversity based on population trends of vertebrate species from around the world.
The index represents 20,811 populations of 4,392 species.
All indices are weighted by species richness, giving species-rich taxonomic groups in terrestrial, marine and freshwater systems more weight than groups with fewer species.
Using a method developed by ZSL and WWF, these species population trends are aggregated to produce indices of the state of biodiversity.The index value is measured relative to species' populations in 1970 (i.e.
1970 = 1).To calculate an LPI, a generalised additive modelling framework is used to determine the underlying trend in each population time-series.
Average rates of change are then calculated and aggregated to the species level.
For the global LPI, the method of aggregation has recently been revised to include a weighting system which gives trends from more species-rich systems, realms and groups more weight in the final index.

The authors note:

1.
Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors.
Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it.
The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;

2.
this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity).
Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;

3.
non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.

Average per capita fossil fuel production - for coal, oil and gas - was calculated by OWID based on published population and national fossil fuel production data.

Per capita fossil fuel production was calculated by dividing national production of coal, oil or gas by the total population in any given year.

Population data was sourced from a combination of Gapminder sources (for data pre-1950), and from 1950 onwards was sourced from the UN Population Division's 2017 Revision.

Fossil fuel production data was sourced from a combination of sources.

Global data from 1800-1965 was sourced from Vaclav Smil's Updated and Revised Edition of his book, 'Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives' (2017).

The original Maddison Project dataset expresses the population "in thousands".
In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid expressing it "in thousands".

The Maddison region definitions were adapted from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm under the heading "Historical Statistics" and the file titled: Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) 

To calculate average real GDP per capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population.
This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population.

Maternal deaths were calculated by Our World in Data under two scenarios:- extrapolation of average annual progress (during the period 2005-2015) in maternal mortality rates through to 2030; this provides a 'business-as-usual' trajectory;- for countries who would not under a business-as-usual trajectory reach the UN SDG Target 3.1 of at least as low as 70 deaths per 100,000 live births, the required trajectory necessary to reach this target.Maternal deaths were derived from these two scenarios by multiplying the maternal mortality ratio (described below from the World Bank) by the annual number of births under the UN Population Division (2018) median fertility scenario from 2015 to 2030.The difference in maternal deaths between these two trajectories is here assumed to be the 'maternal lives at stake' from not reaching SDG Target 3.1.
Maternal mortality trajectories were calculated by Our World in Data based on a combination of business-as-usual extrapolations of historical trends published by the World Bank (2018).Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births.
The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.The World Bank's source data is derived from: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division.

Here we calculated the average annual change over this period, and applied it from 2015 onwards to derive estimates by 2030.
Note that these figures therefore do not represent a forecast or prediction, but simply represent expected change if progress continues at recent rates.The rates required to reach SDG Target 3.1 (70 per 100,000 live births) were quantified by calculating the average annual rate of decline necessary to reach 70 per 100,000 by 2030 from the 2015 value of a given country.

Closing the poverty gap:The cost of closing the poverty gap does not take into account costs and inefficiencies from making the necessary transfers.The cost of closing the poverty gap is calculated as follows: Poverty Gap Index x Poverty Line (1.9 int-$ per day) x 365 x Population.The poverty gap index for each country corresponds to the estimates available via the option 'Replicate the World Bank's regional aggregation' available in the PovcalNet on-line tool.The unit of measure is international-$ (2011 PPP), in order to allow cross-country comparisons.
This should not be confused with market dollars.
The poverty gap index estimates from the World Bank's PovcalNet data cover low and middle income countries, with observations every three years in the period 1981-2013.
To achieve this level of granularity, the World Bank relies on interpolation for countries in which survey data are not available in particular years, but are available either before or after (or both).
The process of interpolation requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the missing year.
You can read more about this process in http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/methodology.aspx.---Poverty and income groups in non-rich countries:PovcalNet allows to calculate different poverty lines using 2011 PPPs for several reference years (1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013).OWID team calculated different poverty lines to define the consumption groups.
For example, consumption group 1.25 - 1.9 is calculated as follows: 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.9 int-$ per day' minus 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.25 int-$ per day'.Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty.
But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys.
For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.Warning:'Rich' countries are not included in the PovcalNet tables used for these calculations.
Therefore, people belonging to these consumption groups, but living in rich countries (defined by the World Bank) are not represented in these figures.'Non-rich' countries are all countries in the World except: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.---World population in absolute poverty:The share of World population living in Absolute poverty corresponds to the poverty headcount at the World Bank poverty line of 1.9$ per day.Data between 1981 and 2013 are from 'World Total' in PovcalNet's "Regional aggregation using 2011 PPP and .9/day poverty line".The 2030 projection of 4.2% is taken from Ferreira at al.
(World Bank, 2015), p.37.
This projection is "based on the country-specific historic average growth rates for the past 10 years".
According to the report, an alternative projection based on the last 20 years would give 5.7%.---Share living in extreme poverty by region:The share of population living in extreme poverty by world region is calculated dividing the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty by the population living in the region.To calculate the share of population living in extreme poverty at world level OWID team uses the total world population, not the sum of the 6 regions.
In fact, as explained below, the six world regions do not take into account high-income countries.PovcalNet provides regional aggregation using 2011 PPPs and .90/day poverty line for reference years 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed.
Therefore, OWID team calculated the number of the missing variable subtracting the sum of the observed regions from the World Total.
For example, dis-aggregated data is not available for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2013:MENA 2013 = World Total - (East Asia and Pacific + Europe and Central Asia + Latin America and the Caribbean + South Asia + Sub-Saharan Africa).Warning:The most recent figures from the MENA reason do not necessarily reflect the geopolitical turmoil in the region.High-income countries are not included in PovcalNet tables used for this calculations.---World poverty in absolute number by region:PovcalNet provides regional aggregation using 2011 PPPs and .90/day poverty line for reference years 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed.

Data description:Paxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1893-2003.
OWID updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources).
Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various other sources.
IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below.
Moreover, data extension to 2017 means that our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003.Data construction:Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year.
Therefore, we have constructed this dataset which indicates the status of sovereign countries using the values "Yes" and "No".
More specifically, if the year of universal suffrage is less than 1990 for the United States, we coded ‘Universal suffrage to women’ in the United States in 1990 as Yes.
Note that the United States had gained sovereignty by then.
In addition, our dataset doesn’t consider these milestones as ordered achievements in women’s political representation.
Paxton et al (2006) assumed that a country can only elect a woman MP once the universal suffrage has been granted.
However, there are countries whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage.
Therefore, we calculate values for each milestone independently and map countries as per the original source definition of sovereign.Additional data sources: This section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.Year of sovereignty CIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran.
Likewise, we determine end of sovereignty for Libya and Serbia and Montenegro using the same source.

For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament.
This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995.
They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments.
Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year.
If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.Handling data issues: For years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament.
For most countries, the values match exactly.
However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match.
As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003.
Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps.
For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.

The National Material Capabilities dataset, from the Correlates of War (COW) Project, contains long-run estimates of the military power of countries.The COW data series on military expenditure ends in 2012 and it is measured in current currency units; specifically British Pounds up to the year 1914, and US Dollars thereafter.
This reflects the fact that the COW data was originally intended for cross-country comparisons at specific points in time, rather than for tracking changes in military expenditure over the long-run.Considering this, at Our World in Data we have produced a new dataset, based on the COW data, which does allow for comparisons both across countries and time.
Here is a description of what we have done.
<ol>	<li>We first took the COW dataset and used historical exchange rates from the Bank of England to unify the entire series into a single currency (nominal British Pounds).</li>	<li>Then we converted this series into shares of GDP.
For this we used historical cross-country estimates of nominal GDP, also available in British Pounds from the CEPII research centre.</li>	<li>Finally, we extended the series forward up until 2016 by appending data from SIPRI, as published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?page" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</li></ol>Please note that we use exchange rates from the Bank of England because the original exchange rates used to produce the COW estimates are not available.
While we are aware that this introduces noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in any systematic way.
It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates already had.Also note that the entity 'World' shows values from SIPRI for the period 1960-2016.

The Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) compiles a cross-nationally harmonised set of time use surveys where recorded variables have been comparably recoded.
Activities are sorted into 24 categories for the population aged between 21-65.
We restrict our sample to working-age adults to minimise the role of time allocation decisions with a strong inter-temporal component following <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55560/1/508634636.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aguiar and Hurst (2006)</a>.
The following methodology was used to arrive at the minutes spent across the 24 recorded activities:<ul><li>Using the MTUS simple dataset, the sample was restricted to individuals aged between 21-65.</li><li>The minutes spent on each activity were weighted by the ‘propwt’ variable which brings the sample in line with the population from which it was drawn and ensures only good quality diaries are used.
More information on the construction of ‘propwt’ can be found here: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/chapter-5-weights-in-mtus.pdf </li><li>To calculate the mean number of minutes spent on an activity in a country in a given year, we took an average of the number of minutes spent on each of the 24 activities reported by the diarists.
All diary entries where no minutes are recorded for a certain activity are treated as missing and are not included in the calculated average.
<a href="https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf" rel="noopener" target"_blank">Gershuny and Fisher (2016)</a> mention "it is impossible to say for certain if [entries of zero minutes] is because the diarist did not do the activity or if the diarist actually did undertake the activity but did not report it in the diary".
Therefore, estimates should be interpreted as an upper bound for the average number of minutes spent on an activity by those diarists who have reported taking part in an activity.</li><li>The data is normalised to 1440 minutes per day.
In other words, countries for which time use does not sum to 1440 minutes after weighting and averaging, the missing minutes are equally distributed across all activities.
</li></ul>Please see Table 1.1 for a list of all the surveys and years included and Table 1.2 for technical information on each time use survey: https://www.timeuse.org/sites/default/files/9727/mtus-user-guide-r9-february-2016.pdf

Data on the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, in addition to the number that made landfall in the United States, as published in the HURDAT (Hurricane Database) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).This data runs from 1851 through to the latest annual data.Hurricanes are categorised by the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) which classifies by five categories (1 being the lowest; 5 the highest) based on the intensity of sustained winds.
This scale estimates potential property damage.
Major hurricanes are defined as those with a 3, 4 or 5 rating on the SSHWS; these are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage.The NOAA notes that because of the sparseness of towns and cities before 1900 in some coastal locations along the United States, the data prior to 1900 may not be complete for all states."ACE" is an abbreviation for "Accumulated Cyclone Energy".
ACE is an index that combines the numbers of systems, how long they existed and how intense they became.
It is calculated by squaring the maximum sustained surface wind in the system every six hours that the cyclone is a Named Storm and summing it up for the season.The Power Dissipation Index (PDI) accounts for cyclone strength, duration, and frequency.
he lines have been smoothed using a five-year weighted average, plotted at the middle year.
The most recent average (2011–2015) is plotted at 2013.

This dataset provides information on nuclear weapons states, using data from Bleek (2017), which we double-checked with information from the Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022) for recent years.The dataset distinguishes between countries not considering (score 0), considering (score of 1), pursuing (score 2), possessing nuclear weapons (score 3).
A country is coded as not considering nuclear weapons if it neither considers, pursues, or possesses nuclear weapons.A country is coded as considering nuclear weapons if its leaders explore whether it is possible and desirable for them to attempt to acquire nuclear weapons, or they work to increase their nuclear weapons capabilities, but without launching a dedicated program.A country is coded as pursuing nuclear weapons if it has an active program to acquire nuclear weapons or to obtain the ability to construct them on short notice.A country is coded as possessing nuclear weapons if it has a nuclear-explosive device that it can deliver.
Conducting an explosive nuclear test is therefore neither sufficient nor nor necessary.Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine are not coded as possessing nuclear weapons because they never had operational control of the nuclear weapons left over from the Soviet Union.You can read more about specific countries in the profiles by Bleek (2017) and the Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022) by following the links.

UCDP defines state-based armed conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concernsgovernment and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”The conflict is listed in all years that the 25 deaths threshold is met (but not otherwise).The data is organised by year and conflict.
We aggregate this to provide the number of conflicts in each year, broken down by the conflict type and region.
This dataset runs from 1946 and aims to have global coverage over this period.
Accordingly, we add a zero deaths observation for year-region-conflict type combinations that do appear in the dataset.The labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised internal' and 'Interstate'.Note that in this dataset the location refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.

Definitions

People are considered 'multidimensional poor' if they are deprived in at least one third of the weighted indicators.

The ten indicators relate to: Years of Schooling, Child School Attendance, Child Mortality, Nutrition, Electricity, Sanitation, Drinking Water, Floor, Cooking Fuel, Asset Ownership.
The first four of these indicators carry a weight of one sixth each (i.e.
0.166).
The other six have a weight of one eighteenth each (i.e.
0.055)

Survey data

Years correspond to the year reported for the underlying survey used as source in each country.
Whenever surveys correspond to year intervals (e.g.
2011-2012), we display the end year for that interval.

The source notes that "The global MPI was first released in 2010, for 104 developing countries, and has been updated yearly with the latest data available.
Starting from winter 2014/2015, updates are now made twice a year, in summer and winter.
In June 2015, the Global MPI was updated for 32 countries and 6 new countries have been added to the list of those last reported in 2014.

Rates of patent application and scientific/technical publication were calculated by OurWorldinData based on a combination of World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI) and United Nations Population Prospects estimates.

Rates were calculated per million people by dividing the absolute number of patent applications and scientific & technical journal articles (as published by the World Bank) by UN population estimates for any given year.

The World Bank indicators were based on "patent applications, residents" which measures the number of patent applications from residents of a given country; "patent applications, nonresidents" which measures the number of patent applications for any given country from individuals outside of that country.
Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.
A patent provides protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for a limited period, generally 20 years.

"Scientific and technical journal articles" which measures the number of scientific and engineering articles published in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine, biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.

Sources further inland are significantly less likely to end up as ocean debris.The authors define mismanaged and inadequately managed waste as follows: "mismanaged waste is material that is either littered or inadequately disposed.
Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained.
Mismanaged waste could eventually enter the ocean via inland waterways,wastewater outflows, and transport by wind or tides."In October 2019, per capita plastic waste figures for Trinidad and Tobago were updated from 3.6kg to 0.29kg per person per day.

	Additional information: 
Estimates of population sustained with and without the production of Haber-Bosch nitrogen are derived based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al.
(2008) and its sources.
World population figures were sourced from Gapminder for the years 1900-1949, and from the UN Population Division from 1950 onwards.
The share of the world's population reliant on Haber-Bosch fertilizer production for food production was estimated based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al.
(2008).
These figures are based on approximation, although coincide with several published projections of these estimates.
Erisman et al.
estimate that by 2000, 44% of the global population were sustained by Haber-Bosch nitrogen, rising to 48% by 2008.
This approximately coincides with Smil (2002) estimates of 40% by 2000.
OWID have extrapolated these estimates to 2015, assuming that approximately 50% (±2%) rely on Haber-Bosch nitrogen.

The prevalence of undernourishment expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an active and healthy life.
The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy requirement.
Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population.This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9.The indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1969-71 to 2014-16 to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.The FAO has maintained a constant definition of "developing countries" throughout the data series, with the following definition: "Includes all countries other than developed countries, namely: all countries in Africa except South Africa, all countries in Asia except Israel and Japan, all countries in Oceania except Australia and New Zealand, and all countries in North and Central America except Canada and USA, and all countries in South America."The aggregates are computed using a weighted population average.Earlier estimates for the prevalence of undernourishment in developing countries for 1970 and 1980.
Over this period, methodological methods for the estimation of undernourishment have been refined for use in tracking progress on MDGs from 1990 onwards- this means earlier estimates have a higher level of uncertainty.
Figures given here for 1970 and 1980 have been taken as the average between two FAO estimates from annual "State of Food Insecurity in the World" reports in 2006 and 2010 (referenced below).
These estimates should therefore be utilised with caution, but have been included for longer-term perspective on reduction trends.References:FAO.

Data on vitamin-A deficiency is based on the reported prevalence of risk by the World Health Organization, which has collated national and household level survey data on indicators extending the period 1995-2005.
Note that data on vitamin-A deficiency is typically not measured on an annual basis, therefore the year of measurement will vary by country, but lie within the period 1995-2005.All countries with a GDP per capita ≥US5,000 were assumed by the WHO to be free from vitamin-A deficiency of a public health significance and were therefore excluded.
None of these 37 countries had retinol or night blindness data reported for either preschool-age children or pregnant women.Two sets of indicators of VAD are commonly used for population surveys: clinically assessed eye signs and biochemically determined concentrations of retinol in plasma or serum.
The incidence of night blindness in individuals indicates moderate-to-severe systemic VAD.
VAD can also be identified when serum retinol concentrations fall below below a cut-off value of 0.70 µmol/l.Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major nutritional concern in poor societies, especially in lower income countries.
Its presence as a public health problem is assessed by measuring the prevalence of deficiency in a population, represented by specific biochemical and clinical indicators of status.
The main underlying cause of VAD as a public health problem is a diet that is chronically insufficient in vitamin A that can lead to lower body stores and fail to meet physiologic needs (e.g.
support tissue growth, normal metabolism, resistance to infection).
Deficiency of sufficient duration or severity can lead to disorders that are common in vitamin A deficient populations such as xerophthalmia (xeros = dryness; -ophthalmia = pertaining to the eye), the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness, anaemia, and weakened host resistance to infection, which can increase the severity of infectious diseases and risk of death.

There are three main types of nails: hand forged, machine cut, and wire.
Blacksmiths produced hand forged nails until about 1820.
Cut nails have been produced using a machine which cuts nails from sheets of iron or steel - technology patents for this machinery emerging in the late 18th century.
Wire nails became more widely produced in the late 19th century with individual nails cut from a coil of drawn wire, one end sharpened at the tip, and the head of the nail added to the other (Sichel (2017)).


Real prices are calculated using Sichel’s (2017) consumer price index (CPI) dating back to 1695 constructed from the UK retail price index (RPI) from 1695-1784, and US CPI from 1784-2011.
2010 is used as the base year, so all prices adjusted for inflation are in terms of 2010 dollars.
To calculate real price of nails in cents/lb, we use the following procedure:

Real price of nails (cents/lb) = Nominal price of nails (cents/lb) divided by (CPI /100) 

However, the real price of nails measured in units of cents per pound can obscure quality differences.
To adjust for differences in quality, Sichel (2017) standardizes nail sizes, converting all nails to be as close as possible to a 2”, size 6d nail, to construct real prices in cents per nail.
The counts of nails per pound used for each year can be found in Table 3 of Sichel’s (2017) working paper.

In calculating the real price of nails (cents/nail), we first convert units from cents per pound to cents per nail, and then convert from nominal to real prices.


Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nail (cents/lb) x 1/[count of nails per pound]

Real price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) divided by (CPI/100)

The nominal price series for nails, from which the real series have been constructed, are comprised of multiple data sources.


From 1695 to 1792, prices are from Beveridge (1939) in the United Kingdom.
Where data is not reported for selected years, the values for these years are interpolated.
Prices have been converted from shillings to cents.


For the period 1784 to 1813 prices are sourced from Cole (1938) although the type of nails have not been specified and are thus assumed to be mixed (forged and cut) nails.


From 1814 to 1890 data covers machine-cut nail prices.
Between 1814 and 1828, prices are taken from Cole (1938).
Quotes for later years are from various sources with the data reproduced in ‘Historical Statistics of the United States’.


The period covering 1890 up until 2011 refers to wire nails.
This section of the data series includes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

For greater detail in the construction of this dataset, please see Sichel’s (2017)* working paper referenced below.

In order for an election to be included, voters must directly elect the person or persons appearing on the ballot to the national post in question.Elections may or may not be competitive, and may have any number of other ostensible flaws.

Data on agricultural land ownership by gender is available and reported by the FAO across 102 countries.
Currently this data is not available as a time-series, and is limited to measurement in a single census year.
Note that this census year is not consistent across all countries.
Data for most European and North American countries is based on 2010-11 datasets, whereas other countries can extend from 1993-2011.
For graphing consistency, this has been shown as a single year (e.g.
assuming these figures are representative of 2011).
The actual years of measurement for each country can be found in the referenced FAO report and database.The FAO's publication on its Gender and Land Rights Database notes the following definition:"The agricultural landowner is defined as the legal owner of the agricultural land; however, definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys.
The indicator may not necessarily reflect documented ownership certified by a legal document.
Especially in places where much of the land is not formally titled or documented, surveys often simply ask whether someone in the household owns the land, and if so, who owns it.
In addition to officially titled ownership, it may also include proxies, such as the right to use, sell or bequeath the land, or the right to use it as collateral.
This enables the indicator to capture different aspects of the “bundle of rights” related to land, rather than land ownership in the strictest sense of the term.
The current indicator in the GLRD uses different definitions of ownership; they are specified for each country in the data notes.
As data for more countries become available, it will be useful to calculate these measures using more than one definition of ownership.An individual is defined as a landowner whether they own land solely (they are the only owner of a plot of land) or jointly with someone inside or outside the household.
Thus, households may have multiple landowners.
In addition, households may own multiple plots of land with different owners identified for each plot."References:FAO (2015).

Additional info on Population data:

As explained by their Guidance for Data: "the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program (PEP) releases several different data series over the course of each decade".


Total U.S.
population figures for the period 2007-2010 are taken from the 'Intercensal Estimates 2000-2010'.
Each decade, PEP releases these 'Intercensal Estimates' which constitutes the preferred data series for the decade.
 

Total U.S.
population figures for the period 2011-2016 are taken from the 'National Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016'.
These estimates "are produced using a similar procedure to that used for our current postcensal estimates series, and with no knowledge of the Census count at the end of the decade."

The Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) keeps an incident log that is updated with each new shark attack.
Four types of shark attack categories are included: provoked, unprovoked, boating incidents, and sea disasters.
The GSAF defines provoked incidents as incidents in which "the shark was speared, hooked, captured or in which a human drew 'first blood'" versus unprovoked incidents where this behaviour did not occur.
Boating incidents are defined as cases where "a boat was bitten or rammed by a shark." Sea disasters are "accidents that place people in the day-to-day business of sharks." Shark attacks classified as "Invalid" or "Questionable" have been excluded from estimates.The link above provides more details about the type, area, location, activity, whether the victim was a male or female, their age, description of the injury, time of the incident, shark species, and investigator/source for each observation.
Where a range of dates is provided for a particular incident, we have used the earliest year when plotting the data.

DefinitionsSocial spending includes, among others, the following areas: health, old age, incapacity-related benefits, family, active labor market programmes, unemployment, and housing.
In some studies and reports, education is included in social spending.
This is not the case in this dataset.Handling of underlying sourcesThis dataset was constructed by combining three sources.
These are the OECD Social Expenditure Database (OECD SOCX), OECD (1985) and Lindert (2004).These three sources were combined as follows.
For the period 1980-2016 we report the figures as published in OECD SOCX.
For the period 1960-1979, we extended the recent figures (from OECD SOCX) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1985).
And for the period 1880-1930, we took observations from Lindert (2004).To be precise, the data for the period 1960-1979 was obtained by relying on the earliest available observation from OECD SOCX, and then successively extending the series backwards by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD (1985).
Here is an example:OECD_SOCX_(Year-1) = [OECD_SOCX_(Year)] x [OECD_1985_(year-1)]/[ OECD_1985_(year)]Backward extrapolation for the period 1960-1979 was necessary because the levels in the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years.
The implicit assumption, then, is that the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) have different levels, but common trends.In this visualization (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/various-measures-of-social-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp?country=AUS) you can see how the various underlying sources compare to our constructed series.Further remarksAccording to the Manual to the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), the OECD defines social expenditure as “The provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or transfer”The series on Social expenditure for France and Denmark in OECD(1985) are not complete.
However, Lindert (2004) uses the data available to estimate social expenditure in 1960 and 1970.
Therefore, we use his estimations to extrapolate backwards for those two points in time.In OECD (1985) social expenditure figures include expenditure on education.
To ensure consistency with Lindert (2004) and OECD (SOCX), we subtracted education.

The UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset provides data on direct deaths arising from 'state-based' conflicts.
 UCDP defines state-based armed conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”Both civilian and military deaths are included.
Deaths due to disease or famine caused by conflict, as well as extra-judicial killings in custody, are excluded.The data is organised by year and conflict.
We aggregate this to provide total numbers of deaths each year, broken down by the conflict type and region.
This dataset runs from 1989 and aims to have global coverage over this period.
Accordingly, we add a zero deaths observation for year-region-conflict type combinations that do appear in the dataset.The labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised internal' and 'Interstate'.Note that in this dataset the location refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.To extend the data back further in time we rely on the PRIO Battledeaths Datset, produced according to the same definitions and structure as the UCDP Battle-related Deaths Dataset.
The PRIO data runs from 1946 to 2008 and is no longer maintained.
We aggregated the PRIO data in the same way as the UCDP data, and then constructed a final joint series which consists of the PRIO data from 1946 to 1988 and the UCDP data from 1989 onwards.

Teachers are marked as absent from school if during the second unannounced visit, they are not found anywhere on the school premises.
Otherwise, they are marked as present.
Teachers are marked as absent from class if during the second unannounced visit, they are absent from school or present at school but absent from the classroom.
Otherwise, they are marked as present.
The scheduled teaching time is the length of the school day minus break time.
Time spent teaching adjusts the length of the school day by the share of teachers who are present in the classroom, on average, and the time the teacher spends teaching while in the classroom.
The orphaned classrooms measure is the ratio of the classrooms with students but no teacher to the number of classrooms with students with or without a teacher.
All individual country statistics are calculated using country-specific sampling weights.
The average for all countries is taken by averaging over the country columns.
Hence, each country is given equal weight.

The Global Terrorism Database definitions can be found at (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf) and are as follows:A terrorist incident is included in GTD if it is the following:- The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.- The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.- The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors.
The database does not include acts of state terrorism.In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:- Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal.
In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion.
It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.- Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims.
It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention.
As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.- Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities.
That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants).Is it defined as a suicide attack?This variable is coded “Yes” in those cases where there is evidence that the perpetrator did not intend to escape from the attack alive.
Successful vs.
unsuccessful attacks:"The GTD does include attacks that were attempted but ultimately unsuccessful.
The circumstances vary depending on tactics (for details see the success variable, below).
However, in general if a bomb is planted but fails to detonate; if an arsonist is intercepted by authorities before igniting a fire; or, if an assassin attempts and fails to kill his or her intended target, the attack is considered for inclusion in the GTD, but denoted as unsuccessful.Success of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack.
Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators.
For example, a bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression.
The definition of a successful attack depends on the type of attack.
Essentially, the key question is whether or not the attack type took place.
If a case has multiple attack types, it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the exception of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed."Fatalities are defined as:"The number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident.
The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident.
Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank.
If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident.
Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident."Injuries are:"the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims."

As explained by the Global Terrorism Database (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf):Data denotes the general type of target/victim.
When a victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive.
Forexample, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” This variable consists of the following 22 categories:1 = BUSINESSBusinesses are defined as individuals or organizations engaged in commercial or mercantile activity as a means of livelihood.
Any attack on a business or private citizens patronizing a business such as a restaurant, gas station, music store, bar, café, etc.
This includes attacks carried out against corporate offices or employees of firms like mining companies, or oil corporations.
Furthermore, includes attacks conducted on business people or corporate officers.
Included in this value as well are hospitals and chambers of commerce and cooperatives.
Does not include attacks carried out in public or quasi-public areas such as “business district or commercial area”, or generic business-related individuals such as“businessmen” (these attacks are captured under “Private Citizens and Property”, see below.) Also does not include attacks against generic business-related individuals such as “businessmen.” Unless the victims were targeted because of their specific business affiliation, these attacks belong in “Private Citizens and Property.”2 = GOVERNMENT (GENERAL)Any attack on a government building; government member, former members, including members of political parties in official capacities, their convoys, or events sponsored by political parties; political movements; or a government sponsored institution where the attack is expressly carried out to harm the government.
This value includes attacks on judges, public attorneys (e.g., prosecutors), courts and court systems, politicians, royalty, head of state, government employees (unless police or military), election-related attacks, or intelligence agencies and spies.
This value does not include attacks on political candidates for office or members of political parties that do not hold an elected office (these attacks are captured in “Private Citizens and Property”).3 = POLICEThis value includes attacks on members of the police force or police installations; this includes police boxes, patrols headquarters, academies, cars, checkpoints, etc.
Includes attacks against jails or prison facilities, or jail or prison staff or guards.4 = MILITARYIncludes attacks against military units, patrols, barracks, convoys, jeeps, and aircraft.
Also includes attacks on recruiting sites, and soldiers engaged in internal policing functions such as at checkpoints and in anti narcotics activities.
This category also includes peacekeeping units that conduct military operations (e.g., AMISOM).
Excludes attacks against non-state militias and guerrillas, these types of attacks are coded as “Terrorist/Non-state Militias” see below.5 = ABORTION RELATEDAttacks on abortion clinics, employees, patrons, or security personnel stationed at clinics.6 = AIRPORTS & AIRCRAFTAn attack that was carried out either against an aircraft or against an airport.
Attacks against airline employees while on board are also included in this value.
Includes attacks conducted against airport business offices and executives.
Military aircraft are not included.7 = GOVERNMENT (DIPLOMATIC)Attacks carried out against foreign missions, including embassies, consulates, etc.
This value includes cultural centers that have diplomatic functions, and attacks against diplomatic staff and their families (when the relationship is relevant to the motive of the attack) and property.
The United Nations is a diplomatic target.8 = EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONAttacks against schools, teachers, or guards protecting school sites.
Includes attacks against university professors, teaching staff and school buses.
Moreover, includes attacks against religious schools in this value.
As noted below in the “Private Citizens and Property” value, the GTD has several attacks against students.
If attacks involving students are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are carried out in an educational setting, they are coded as private citizens and property.
Excludes attacks against military schools (attacks on military schools are coded as “Military,” see below).9 = FOOD OR WATER SUPPLYAttacks on food or water supplies or reserves are included in this value.
This generally includes attacks aimed at the infrastructure related to food and water for human consumption.10 = JOURNALISTS & MEDIAIncludes, attacks on reporters, news assistants, photographers, publishers, as well as attacks on media headquarters and offices.
Attacks on transmission facilities such as antennae or transmission towers, or broadcast infrastructure are coded as “Telecommunications,” see below.11 = MARITIME (INCLUDES PORTS AND MARITIME FACILITIES)Includes civilian maritime: attacks against fishing ships, oil tankers, ferries, yachts, etc.
(Attacks on fishermen are coded as “Private Citizens and Property,” see below).12 = NGOIncludes attacks on offices and employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
NGOs here include large multinational non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders, as well as domestic organizations.13= OTHERThis value includes acts of terrorism committed against targets which do not fit into other categories.
Some examples include ambulances, firefighters, and international demilitarized zones.14= PRIVATE CITIZENS & PROPERTYThis value includes attacks on individuals, the public in general or attacks in public areas including markets, commercial streets, busy intersections and pedestrian malls.
Also includes ambiguous cases where the target/victim was a named individual, or where the target/victim of an attack could be identified by name, age, occupation, gender or nationality.
This value also includes ceremonial events, such as weddings and funerals.
The GTD contains a number of attacks against students.
If these attacks are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are not carried out in an educational setting, these attacks are coded using this value.
Also, includes incidents involving political supporters as private citizens and property, provided that these supporters are not part of a government-sponsored event.
Finally, this value includes police informers.
Does not include attacks causing civilian casualties in businesses such as restaurants, cafes or movie theaters (these categories are coded as “Business” see above).15 = RELIGIOUS FIGURES/INSTITUTIONSThis value includes attacks on religious leaders, (Imams, priests, bishops, etc.), religious institutions (mosques, churches), religious places or objects (shrines, relics, etc.).
This value also includes attacks on organizations that are affiliated with religious entities that are not NGOs, businesses or schools.
Attacks on religious pilgrims are considered “Private Citizens and Property;” attacks on missionaries are considered religious figures.16 = TELECOMMUNICATIONThis includes attacks on facilities and infrastructure for the transmission of information.
More specifically this value includes things like cell phone towers, telephone booths, television transmitters, radio, and microwave towers.17 = TERRORISTS/NON-STATE MILITIASTerrorists or members of identified terrorist groups within the GTD are included in this value.
Membership is broadly defined and includes informants for terrorist groups, but excludes former or surrendered terrorists.This value also includes cases involving the targeting of militias and guerillas.18 = TOURISTSThis value includes the targeting of tour buses, tourists, or “tours.” Tourists are persons who travel primarily for the purposes of leisure or amusement.
Government tourist offices are included in this value.
The attack must clearly target tourists, not just an assault on a business or transportation system used by tourists.
Travel agencies are coded as business targets.19 = TRANSPORTATION (OTHER THAN AVIATION)Attacks on public transportation systems are included in this value.
This can include efforts to assault public buses, minibuses, trains, metro/subways, highways (if the highway itself is the target of the attack), bridges, roads, etc.
The GTD contains a number of attacks on generic terms such as “cars” or “vehicles.” These attacks are assumed to be against “Private Citizens and Property” unless shown to be against public transportation systems.
In this regard, buses are assumed to be public transportation unless otherwise noted.20 = UNKNOWNThe target type cannot be determined from the available information.21 = UTILITIESThis value pertains to facilities for the transmission or generation of energy.
For example, power lines, oil pipelines, electrical transformers, high tension lines, gas and electric substations, are all included in this value.
This value also includes lampposts or street lights.
Attacks on officers, employees or facilities of utility companies excluding the type of facilities above are coded as business.22 = VIOLENT POLITICAL PARTIESThis value pertains to entities that are both political parties (and thus, coded as “government” in this coding scheme) and terrorists.
It is operationally defined as groups that engage in electoral politics and appear as “Perpetrators” in the GTD.

This metric captures the general method of a terrorist attack and often reflects the broad class of tactics used.
It consists of nine categories, which are defined below.1 = ASSASSINATIONAn act whose primary objective is to kill one or more specific, prominent individuals.
Usually carried out on persons of some note, such as highranking military officers, government officials, celebrities, etc.
Not to include attacks on non-specific members of a targeted group.
The killing of a police officer would be an armed assault unless there is reason to believe the attackers singled out a particularly prominent officer for assassination.2 = ARMED ASSAULTAn attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by use of a firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.).
Not to include attacks involving the use of fists, rocks, sticks, or other handheld (less-than-lethal) weapons.
Also includes attacks involving certain classes of explosive devices in addition to firearms, incendiaries, or sharp instruments.
The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown.3 = BOMBING/EXPLOSIONAn attack where the primary effects are caused by an energetically unstable material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage to the surrounding environment.
Can include either high or low explosives (including a dirty bomb) but does not include a nuclear explosive device that releases energy from fission and/or fusion, or an incendiary device where decomposition takes place at a much slower rate.
If an attack involves certain classes of explosive devices along with firearms, incendiaries, or sharp objects, then the attack is coded as an armed assault only.
The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown in which the bombers are also using firearms or incendiary devices.4 = HIJACKINGAn act whose primary objective is to take control of a vehicle such as an aircraft, boat, bus, etc.
for the purpose of diverting it to an unprogrammed  destination, force the release of prisoners, or some other political objective.
Obtaining payment of a ransom should not the sole purpose of a Hijacking, but can be one element of the incident so long as additional objectives have also been stated.
Hijackings are distinct from Hostage Taking because the target is a vehicle, regardless of whether there are people/passengers in the vehicle.5 = HOSTAGE TAKING (BARRICADE INCIDENT)An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations.
Such attacks are distinguished from kidnapping since the incident occurs and usually plays out at the target location with little or no intention to hold the hostages for an extended period in a separate clandestine location.6 = HOSTAGE TAKING (KIDNAPPING)An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations.
Kidnappings are distinguished from Barricade Incidents (above) in that they involve moving and holding the hostages in another location.7 = FACILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACKAn act, excluding the use of an explosive, whose primary objective is to cause damage to a non-human target, such as a building, monument, train, pipeline, etc.
Such attacks include arson and various forms of sabotage (e.g., sabotaging a train track is a facility/infrastructure attack, even if passengers are killed).
Facility/infrastructure attacks can include acts which aim to harm an installation, yet also cause harm to people incidentally (e.g.
an arson attack primarily aimed at damaging a building, but causes injuries or fatalities).8 = UNARMED ASSAULTAn attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by any means other than explosive, firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.).
Attacks involving chemical, biological or radiological weapons are considered unarmed assaults.9 = UNKNOWNThe attack type cannot be determined from the available information.

This dataset is an excerpt from the data provided by the United Nations Statistics Division under the Minimum Set of Gended Indicators.
Cross-country comparability is limited due to lack of uniform definitions.
Importantly, the ages of the relevant population differ from country to country (and in a few instances, they also differ from year to year for the same country).
For most low-income countries, the figures include children among the relevant population.
For most high-income countries, children below 15 are excluded.
Additionally, in some countries the estimates correspond only to specific regions (e.g.
urban).
This file provides a column with notes explaining the particular reference population in each case.Regarding the definitions, the original source notes: "Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys.
Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age.
In the former type of averages the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants).
In the latter type of averages the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof) regardless of whether people performed the activity or not.
All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population.
This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time.
Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants or both.
Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day.
It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated)."

Whenever possible, the source reports data on merchandise trade, excluding trade in services and re-exports.
Some specific goods are also excluded (the authors highlight the omission of bullion and species in historical data).Since re-exports are excluded, special import data is favored over general import data (special imports have the importing country as their final destination, whereas general trade is composed of special trade, together with transit trade).To calculate total exports to the rest of the world as a share of GDP, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:UK-exports-to-the-world-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three countries in the entire sample constituting the rest of the world).Export values used rely on the estimate given by the importer as the authors note: "importers have a greater incentive to properly assess trade flows as they are commonly subject to duties".
Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current British pounds.

We have combined two sources: The UN Child Mortality Estimates (CME) data and the Human Mortality Database (HMD).

All data points from the CME used.
HMD has been used as a supplement when CME data is not available for a given year.
HMD values are multiplied by factor of 1.1 for Belarus, Hungary and Lithuania (to match CME data as described in Hill et al.
2012).
HMD values are multiplied by a factor of 1.2 for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia (before 1992) (to match CME as described in Hill et al.

Hill et al.
2012 adjust the CME data by these same factors because of concerns about the low levels of early neonatal death recorded in the civil registration systems of these countries compared to western European countries as a result of differences in the definition of live births.

The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) collects cross-national education statistics.
Data on literacy rates come from a variety of sources (such as national censuses and surveys) and reporting modes (self-reporting vs household declarations).


Data instruments used to estimate literacy are grouped under three main types: i) a census; ii) a survey; or iii) indirect estimates.
Indirect estimates are extrapolated - based on educational attainment, or estimated based on the country's census.

Methodologies used for measuring literacy have been grouped into four categories: household declarations, self declarations, literacy tests, and national estimates.
Both household and self-declared literacy are self-reports; in the former, it is the head of the household responding to the survey, and in the latter it is directly reported by the individuals themselves.

UNESCO categorised Chile's (2009) and the Philippines' (2003) mode of literacy reporting as 'Household/Self declaration'.
We have categorised the two countries under the household declaration category.

To construct the long run urbanization series we began with the UN World Urbanization Prospects database covering the period from 1950 to 2050.
Then we extended the series backwards using additional data sources including the US Census Bureau, Bairoch (1988), Kuroda (1984), HYDE 3.1 (2010), and De Vries (1984) to arrive at the longest single series possible for each country and region included.

This was calculated by dividing maternal mortality in each year by maternal mortality in 1900 (therefore 1900 = 100).

– The source notes that in some instances observations differ from the standard definition or refer to only part of a country.


– The dates associated to each observation correspond to the end of the survey used as underlying source 

– Most estimates come from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
The MICS include a standard set of questions covering different disciplinary methods.
It does allow survey respondents to report both violent and nonviolent forms of discipline.

–The source notes that estimates reported in UNICEF publications and in MICS country reports prior to 2010 were calculated using household weights that did not take into account the last-stage selection of children for the administration of the child discipline module in MICS surveys.
(A random selection of one child aged 2–14 is undertaken for the administration of the child discipline module.) In January 2010, it was decided that more accurate estimates are produced by using a household weight that takes the last-stage selection into account.
MICS3 data were recalculated using this approach.
All estimates produced after 2010 use the revised estimates.

– When it was first implemented in MICS3, the child discipline module was administered only to mothers/primary caregivers, who were asked whether any of the disciplinary methods covered in the module had been used by any member of the household during the month preceding the interview.
Beginning with MICS4, the methodology was changed: Any adult household member, not just the mother or primary caregiver, can now respond to the questions on child discipline.

Data definitions for each variable included in the AQUASTAT Database is as follows:Agricultural water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture purposes.
It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.
Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal."Industrial water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial uses.
It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.
This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network.
The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%.
It includes water for the cooling of thermoelectric and nuclear power plants, but it does not include hydropower.
Water withdrawn by industries that are connected to the public supply network is generally included in municipal water withdrawal."Municipal water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for the direct use by the population.
It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.
It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network.
It can include that part of the industries and urban agriculture, which is connected to the municipal network.
The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas."Irrigation water requirement: "The quantity of water exclusive of precipitation and soil moisture (i.e.
quantity of irrigation water) required for normal crop production.
It consists of water to ensure that the crop receives its full crop water requirement (i.e.
irrigation consumptive water use, as well as extra water for flooding of paddy fields to facilitate land preparation and protect the plant and for leaching salt when necessary to allow for plant growth).
It is usually expressed in water depth (millimetres) or water volume (m3) and may be stated in monthly, seasonal or annual terms, or for a crop period.
It corresponds to net irrigation water requirement."Irrigation water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes.
In the AQUASTAT database water withdrawal for irrigation is part of agricultural water withdrawal, together with water withdrawal for livestock (watering and cleaning) and water withdrawal for aquaculture.
It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.
The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation by far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops.
The term "water requirement ratio" (sometimes also called "irrigation efficiency") is used to indicate the ratio between the net irrigation water requirements or crop water requirements, which is the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the growing period of the crop, and the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation including the losses.
In the specific case of paddy rice irrigation, additional water is needed for flooding to facilitate land preparation and for plant protection.
In that case, irrigation water requirements are the sum of rainfall deficit and the water needed to flood paddy fields.
At scheme level, water requirement ratio values can vary from less than 20 percent to more than 80 percent."Total water withdrawal: "Annual quantity of water withdrawn for agricultural, industrial and municipal purposes.
It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.
It does not include in-stream uses, which are characterized by a very low net consumption rate, such as recreation, navigation, hydropower, inland capture fisheries, etc."

All estimates correspond to pooled data for the period 2009-2019, using population weights.Estimates rely on the ATUS "Who File".
This is a file that indicates who was present during each activity recorded.
People can be counted twice, which means that attending a party with friends and your spouse, for example, would count for both categories.
Sleeping is excluded.<b> Further notes </b>- Some of the original "Who Codes" have be re-coded and grouped (e.g.
'roommate' has been coded as 'friend')- In the ATUS "Who File" there is one record for each person reported present.
Therefore, there will be one record for activities done alone and multiple records for activities with multiple people present.
For some activities, no “who” codes are collected (such as sleeping and grooming).

The Women's Economic Opportunity (WEO) Index measures five categories to determine whether the environment for both women employees and women entrepreneurs is favourable.
Five category scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of underlying indicators and scaled 0-100, where 100=most favourable.
These categories are: Labor policy and practice (comprising two sub-categories: Labor policy and labor practice); Access to Finance; Education and training; Women's legal and social status; and the General business environment.
Each category or sub-category features either four or five underlying indicators.The overall score (from 0-100) is calculated from a simple average of the unweighted category and indicator variables.
That is, every indicator contributes equally to their parent category and every category contributes equally to the overall score.EIU note: The criteria used in this study were chosen in close consultation between the Economist Intelligence Unit and panels of experts, mostly in 2009 and 2010.
The indicator list was reviewed and revised at an experts meeting held at the offices of UN Women in July 2011.World Bank classifications include entities: High income (OECD), High income, High income (non-OECD), Upper-middle income, Lower-middle income, Low income, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Data construction:Paxton et al (2006) provides data on five milestones of women’s political representation from 1893 to 2003.
Our dataset updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources).Paxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1945-2003.
Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various sources.
IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below.
Moreover, this data extension to 2017 means our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003.
Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year.
We have therefore derived the number of sovereign countries generated in any given year, as well as the number which have attained each of the five milestones.To overcome methodological differences, the attainment of milestones was assessed in two ways.
Firstly, the number and share of sovereign countries were assessed relative to ‘ordered’ milestones.
This results from Paxton et al’s (2006) assumption that a country only has an elected woman MP after universal suffrage is granted.
However, there were 17 countries - Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, South Africa, USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States – whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage.
Secondly, we assessed the number and share of sovereign countries which independently satisfied five milestones.Additional information on data sources: This section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.Sovereignty CIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran.
Likewise, we determine end of sovereignty for Libya and Serbia and Montenegro using the same source.

For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament.
This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995.
They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments.
Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year.
If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.Handling data issues: For years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament.
For most countries, the values match exactly.
However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match.
As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003.
Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps.
For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.

This dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME).We define and calculate 'youth mortality' based on the combination of:- under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)-  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 15).Both of these metrics are available from the UN IGME.
Based on these estimates we calculate 'youth mortality': the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15.
