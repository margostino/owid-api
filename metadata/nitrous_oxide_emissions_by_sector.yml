name: nitrous_oxide_emissions_by_sector
description: |-
    Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e), based on 100-year global warming potential factors for non-CO₂ gases.

    This data is published by country and sector from the CAIT Climate Data Explorer, and downloaded from the Climate Watch Portal. Available here: https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions
