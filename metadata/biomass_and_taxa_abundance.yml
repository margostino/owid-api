name: biomass_and_taxa_abundance
description: |-
    Estimates of the global biomass (measured in tonnes of carbon) and abundance (number of individuals) of different taxonomic groups.

    Due to large uncertainty for some groups, these are used as order-of-magnitude estimates and come with notable error margins.
