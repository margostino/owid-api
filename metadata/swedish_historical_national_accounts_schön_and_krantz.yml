description: 'The source notes: "One should note that present time levels of GDP and
    sector value added in these series differ from data in contemporary official national
    accounts. It is natural that a number of shifts and redefinitions are performed
    in contemporary statistics in relation to structural and technological changes,
    but it is also reasonable that levels in the short contemporary series are adjusted
    to the long historical series rather than the other way around. "'
