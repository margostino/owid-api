description: "The Significant Earthquake Database is a global listing of over 5,700
    earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present. A significant earthquake is classified
    as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused
    moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater,
    Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a
    tsunami.\n\nOur World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake numbers by
    country/location per year. \n\nDue to data availability, reporting and evidence,
    it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical
    record.\n"
