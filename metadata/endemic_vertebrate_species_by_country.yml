name: endemic_vertebrate_species_by_country
description: "Data denotes the number of endemic vertebrate species within a given
    organism group by country. Endemic species are those which are known to naturally
    occur in only one country. \n\nAlso available is the number of these endemic species
    which are categorised as 'threatened'.  'Threatened' species are those in any
    of the three Red List categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable.
    They are considered high or greater risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nThis data
    is only given for the more comprehensively assessed species groups (i.e., where
    >80% of the species in the group have been assessed)."
