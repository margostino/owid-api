description: "Primary energy mix in the United Kingdom by source. This is available
    in absolute terms of million tonnes of oil equivalents (Mtoe) and as a relative
    share of the total energy mix. \n\nPrimary energy mix relates to the quantity
    of energy inputs to the system; thermal losses are not taken into account, meaning
    this does not represent the final energy share. "
