name: hypothetical_meat_consumption_owid_based_on_fao_and_un
description: "This is a hypothetical variable derived by Our World in Data which asks
    the question: \"what would global meat production have to be if everyone in the
    world was to consume the average per capita amount of a given country?\" e.g.
    \"how much meat would we need if everyone in the world consumed the same amount
    of meat as the average UK citizen?\".\n\nThis was derived by multiplying global
    population figures from the UN Population Division (2017 Revision) by per capita
    meat supply of a given, as published by the UN FAO. \n\nSources: \nUN FAO: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/\n\nUN
