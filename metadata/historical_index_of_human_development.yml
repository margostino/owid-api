description: |-
    The Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) is a composite statistic (index) that measures key dimensions of human development:
    - life expectancy
    - literacy
    - educational enrolment
    â€“ and per capita gross domestic product (GDP)

    This particular metric presents the assessed HDI normalised without the variable of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), so includes life expectancy, literacy and schooling rates only.
