description: "The number of children that died before 5 years of age per women is
    calculated by multiplying the child mortality rate by the fertility rate of a
    country for a given year.\n\nChild mortality is the share of newborns who die
    before reaching the age of 5. The dataset comes from version 10 of Gapminder,
    the latest version as of 2019. \n\nTotal fertility rate represents the number
    of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her
    childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility
    rates of the specified year. The dataset comes from version 12 of Gapminder, the
    latest version as of 2019."
