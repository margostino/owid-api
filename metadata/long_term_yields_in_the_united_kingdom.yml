description: "This dataset on agricultural yields in the United Kingdom was constructed
    from yield data from three key sources.\n\n– Data from 1270 - 1870 was taken from
    Broadberry et al (2015), made available by Bank of England. This comprises crop
    yield estimates only for England. For this dataset, we have assumed that yields
    in England are also representative of average UK yields. \n\n– Data from 1870
    to 1960 is taken from Brassley (2000. This is provided over 5-year periods. We
    have assumed these figures for the first year in each 5-year set.\n\n– Data from
    1961 onwards is sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations.\n\nReferences:\nBroadberry, S., Campbell, B. M., Klein, A., Overton,
