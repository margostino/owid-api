description: |
    Rates of infant mortality by sex for selected causes of death. This is based on death rates per 100,000 for infants less than one year old. This is given for a range of leading causes of death for comparison between infant mortality rates in males and females.

    For conciseness and clarity, we have shortened a few of the original IHME causes of death:
    Congenital birth defects = Birth defects
    Congenital heart anomalies = Heart anomalies
    Digestive congenital anomalies = Digestive anomalies
    Neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma = Encephalopathy from asphyxia and trauma
    Neonatal preterm birth = Preterm birth
