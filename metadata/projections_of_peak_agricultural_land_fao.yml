description: |-
    This dataset combines actual reported trends in global agricultural land area from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization from 1961-2014, with future projections from various sources.

    Data for the period 1961-2014 is based on the metric "Agricultural land" from the FAO Database. Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL [accessed 22nd August 2017].

    Agricultural land includes arable land, permanent crops and meadows and pasture land.

    Projections to 2050 are based on those reported in OECD (2012) â€“ OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequences of Inaction. Available at: http://www.oecd.org/environment/indicators-modelling-outlooks/oecdenvironmentaloutlookto2050theconsequencesofinaction.htm [accessed 22nd August 2017].

    The original sources for these projections are as follows:

    FAO/IMAGE = FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation) (2006), World Agriculture Towards 2030/2050, FAO, Rome.

    IAASTD = International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (2009). Global report, Island Press, Washington, DC.

    MEA = Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), Synthesis report, Island Press, Washington, DC.
