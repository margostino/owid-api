    Authors' note: "Absence data are based on direct physical verification of the provider's presence, rather than attendance logbooks or interviews with the faculty head." For the original data, see table 1 in the linked paper.

    The majority of this fieldwork was carried out between October 2002 and April 2003. See the source link for further information on the collection of absence data.
