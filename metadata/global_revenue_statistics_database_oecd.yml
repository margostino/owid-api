description: "In 69 countries, the reporting year of tax revenue coincides with the
    calendar year, whereas 11 have different reporting years.  Where the GDP reporting
    year differs from the calendar year, annual GDP estimates are calculated by aggregating
    quarterly GDP estimates corresponding to each countryâ€™s fiscal (tax) year.\n\nFor
    further information on the OECD classification of taxes, see the OECD's Revenue
    Statistics Interpretative Guide (2017) available at: https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/oecd-classification-taxes-interpretative-guide.pdf\n\nFor
