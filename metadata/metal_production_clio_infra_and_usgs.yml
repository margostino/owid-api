description: "Data on metal production is based on the combination of two sources.\r\n\r\nHistorical
    data from 1850-2011 is sourced from the ClioInfra database, available at: https://www.clio-infra.eu/
    [accessed 9th September 2017].\r\n\r\nThis has been combined with recent data
    from the USGS Mineral Statistics from 2012 onwards. Available at: https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/
    [accessed 9th September 2017].\r\n\r\nBoth sources report primary production in
    thousand metric tonnes.\r\nNote: Gold production is measured in metric tons. "
