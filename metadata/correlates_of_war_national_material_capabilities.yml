description: |-
    The variable 'milex' has been split into two variables as the currency of expenditure changes pre and post-1914. Pre-1914, military expenditure is in thousands of UK pounds and post-1914 it is in thousands of US dollars. Both expenditure figures are measured in current prices.

    For values in real prices: Deflated the pre-1914 series to give the value in 1900 UK £s and  deflated the post-1914 series to give the value in 2000 US $s. Uses Quandl data.
