name: air_pollutant_emissions_oecd
description: "Air pollutant emissions reported for OECD countries, where data is available,
    measured in tonnes per year. \n\nIndexed figures relate to changes since the year
    1990 (1990 is assumed equal to 100). A figure lower than 100 indicates a reduction
    in emissions (e.g. 40 indicates a 60% reduction since 1990). Indexed figures are
    only available for countries with data extending to 1990."
