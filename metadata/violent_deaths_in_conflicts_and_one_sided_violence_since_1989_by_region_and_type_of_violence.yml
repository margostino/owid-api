description: "This data counts civilian and military deaths in conflicts and one-sided
    violence. The data counts only direct violent deaths (i.e. excluding deaths from

    Global version 21.1. This presents deaths estimates for individual events. We
    aggregate deaths across years, broken down by conflict/violence type and by region.\n\n\n\n "
