name: global_average_temperature_anomaly_hadley_centre
description: "The temperature anomaly is measured relative to the 1961-1990 global
    average temperature. Temperatures at this baseline represent an increase of 0.3-0.4
    degrees celcius since pre-Industrial (1850) global average temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe
    data presented here is a combined land-surface air temperature and sea-surface
    temperature series. Upper and lower bounds represent the 95% confidence intervals."
