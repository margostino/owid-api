name: global_precipitation_anomaly
description: "Data shows global precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall
    measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. \n\nThis indicator shows
    annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from
    1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated
    from total annual precipitation in inches. Global anomalies have been determined
    by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid,
    and then averaging the grid cells together."
