    Source notes: In 2004, the Postal Service refined its reporting of addresses on rural and highway contract routes by no longer
    counting vacant addresses (unoccupied for more than 90 days) and addresses of customers who received mail solely
    via Post Office box. Numbers may not add up due to rounding.
