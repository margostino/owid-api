name: supercomputer_power
description: "Data on supercomputer power is sourced from the TOP500 database, which
    tracks and reports the 500 largest supercomputers on a bi-annual basis. \n\nSupercomputer
    power is measured in Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPS), a measure of
    calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations
    are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require
    a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions
    per second."
