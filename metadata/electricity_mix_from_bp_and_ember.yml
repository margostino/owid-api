description: "Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on three main sources: \n–
    BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n–
    Ember Global Electricity Review (2022): https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/global-electricity-review-2022/\n-
    Ember European Electricity Review (2022): https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2022/\n\nEmber
    compile their global dataset from various sources including:\n– Eurostat: Annual
    European generation and import data, and monthly data in some cases where better
    sources are not available.\n– ENTSO-E: Monthly European generation and import
    data.\n– EIA: Annual global generation and import data.\n– UN: Monthly global
    generation data in some cases.\n– GEM: Annual global coal and gas capacity data.\n–
    IRENA: Annual global capacity data for all non-fossil fuel types, and for Other
    Fossil where available.\n– WRI: Annual global capacity data for Other Fossil where
    other sources are not available.\n– European carbon intensities rely on data from
    the European Environment Agency (EEA).\n– A complete list of data sources for
    each individual country in Ember's Global Electricity Review can be found here:

    mix data from BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data.
    BP provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) versus only 1990 from Ember.
    However, BP does not provide data for all countries and is not as up-to-date as
    Ember data. So, where data from Ember is available for a given country or year,
    we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from BP
    where it's not available.\n\nOur World in Data has converted absolute electricity
    production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity
    production."
