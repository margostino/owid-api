    Project Working paper 10\n\nThe original Maddison Project dataset expresses the
    population \"in thousands\". In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid
    expressing it \"in thousands\".\n\nThe Maddison region definitions were adapted
    from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm
    under the heading \"Historical Statistics\" and the file titled: Statistics on
    World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright
    Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) \n\nTo calculate average real GDP per
    capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country
    per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population.
    This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple
    benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population."
