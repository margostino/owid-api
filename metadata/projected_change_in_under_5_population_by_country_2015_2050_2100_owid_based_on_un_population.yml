description: "Population data is based on the Medium UN projection (2017 Edition)
    from 2015-2100. \n\nOur World in Data have derived the change in the projected
    under-5 population between the year 2015 to 2050 (here, denoted as '2050') and
    the change between 2050 to 2100 (here, denoted as '2100'). This was calculated
    simply through the subtraction of 2015 under-5 numbers from projected 2050 figures;
    and 2050 figures subtracted from 2100 projections."
