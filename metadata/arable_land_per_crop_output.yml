name: arable_land_per_crop_output
description: "This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed
    quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). \n\nThis is calculated
    as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production
    index (PIN) here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of
    quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices. \n\nValues
    for arable land use and the crop production index (PIN) is sourced from the UN
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). "
