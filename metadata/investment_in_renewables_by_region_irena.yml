name: investment_in_renewables_by_region_irena
description: 'Data on investment is included for the following renewable energy projects:
    all biomass, waste-to-energy, geothermal and wind projects more than 1MW in capacity;
    all wave and tidal; hydropower projects between 1MW and 50MW; biofuel projects
    of more than one million litres per year; and all solar projects (with estimates
    of rooftop installations less than 1MW). Hydropower projects greater than 50MW
    have not been included in this data, since this technology has been mature for
    decades and is at a different stage of development versus more recent technologies.'
