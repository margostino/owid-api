description: "The Ipsos MORI survey was conducted in 24 countries. An international
    sample of 18,787 adults aged 18-64 in the US and Canada, and age 16-64 in all
    other countries, were interviewed between May 6 and May 21, 2011 via the Ipsos
    Online Panel system.\r\n\r\nResults presented here are in response to the question:
    \"Please indicate whether you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose,
    or strongly oppose each way of producing electricity\" [results for nuclear electricity
    production].\r\n\r\nFour responses were accepted for this question: \"strongly
    support\"; \"somewhat support\"; \"somewhat oppose\"; and \"strongly oppose\".
    We have simplified these results to \"support\" and \"oppose\" by summing the
    former and latter two responses, respectively."
