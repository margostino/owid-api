name: fossil_fuel_production_bp_and_shift
description: |-
    This dataset on fossil fuel production is produced by combining the latest data from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy and the Shift Project Data Portal.

    BP provide fossil fuel production data from 1965 onwards (and crude prices from 1861 onwards). The Shift Data Portal provides long-term data from 1900, but only extends to 2016.

    To maintain consistency with the energy datasets on Our World in Data, we have taken BP data as preference â€“ meaning if BP provides data for the given country and year, this is used. Where data is not available from BP for a given country, or pre-1965 we rely on the Shift Project.

    We have converted primary production in exajoules to terawatt-hours using the conversion factor: 278.
