name: percentage_of_americans_living_alone_by_age_ipums
description: "Samples of the decennial Census (1900-2000) and the 2018 ACS from IPUMS-USA
    has been used to construct variables on the percentage of Americans living alone,
    by age and sex. \n\nWe include only those people who are reported to be living
    in a one-person household and who do not live in group quarters. \n\nThe IPUMS
    defines group quarters as \"largely institutions and other group living arrangements,
    such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to
    year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters
    that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder.\"\n\nWe
    have excluded those recorded to be living in institutions, other group quarters,
    and additional households under the 2000 definition."
