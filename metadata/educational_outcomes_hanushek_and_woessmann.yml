description: "Hanushek, E. A. and Woessmann, L. (2012) – Do better school lead to
    more growth? Cognitive skills, economic outcomes, and causation. In Journal of
    Economic Growth, 17, 267–321. The paper is available on Eric Hanushek's website
    and at the journal's site. \r\n\r\nThe authors standardized the scores to the
    PISA test scale but divided the score then by 100. The PISA test scale has a mean
    of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. \r\n\r\nThe test scores are not given
    for a particular year, but instead are the average of all standardized math and
    science test scores of the international student achievement tests in which that
    country participated. The first of which is from 1964 and the last is from 2003
    – but in general most results come from the later period."
