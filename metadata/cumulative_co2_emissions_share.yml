name: cumulative_co2_emissions_share
description: "Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our
    World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project
    (GCP). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the
    cumulative total. \n\nThis is given as the share of global cumulative emissions
    by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world
    emissions for that given year. \n\nData converted from carbon into carbon dioxide
    (using conversion factor of 3.67). Data for Australia appears to be negative from
    1851-1858; for clarity, these figures have been renormalised to zero.\n\nArchived
    data is held at the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). Reference:
    Tom Boden and Bob Andres (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); Gregg Marland (Appalachian
    State University). Available at: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/"
